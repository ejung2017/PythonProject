## 🤖 [WWDC2025 Siri News Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ejung2017/PythonProject/tree/main/siri_news)

This project analyzes sentiment to address real-time customer feedback and foster strategic decisions, especially in competitive tech markets. Based on 98 news articles scraped about Apple Intelligence Siri during WWDC2025, I tried to understand public expectations and its potential business needs. 

**Key Findings**:
  - 35% showing optimism towards personalization and integration of AI-powered features.
  - 65% showing disappointment due to constant delays and incapabilities to match the users' expectations
  - Word Cloud with filtered keywords

## 📊 [Stock Price Forecast with ARIMA](https://github.com/ejung2017/PythonProject/tree/main/arima_predictive_modeling)

This project applies ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) time-series modeling to forecast stock prices, enabling accurate predictions of financial trends and performance metrics. The user can input a listed stock ticker to get a solid analysis on the stock price trend and advice on the future return. 

*Streamlit URL*: https://stockanalysis-ej.streamlit.app

**Key Deliverables**:
- Interactive web app where the user inputs the ticker and the date range for stock analysis
- ARIMA Time Series Analysis including SMA20, EMA60, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands

## 🏦 [Japanese Regional Bank Stocks Analysis](https://github.com/ejung2017/PythonProject/tree/main/stock_analysis)

This project aims to investigate the relationship between interest rates and regional bank stock prices. Generally, interest rates and stock prices have an inverse relationship, but the impact on banking can be different as banks may benefit from wider profit margins in a rising rate environment. 

**Key Findings**:
- Correlation Coefficient: 0.78
- Positive correlation between Japan's interest rates and Japanese regional bank stock prices
- 1% interest rate rise tied to a 2.3% stock price increase over 12 months, influenced by market sentiment

## 🛍️ [Amazon Product Crawling](https://github.com/ejung2017/PythonProject/tree/main/amazon_review_crawling)

This project compares two products based on the customer reviews and comes up with the most ideal suggestion for a customer (myself). 

**Key Findings**:
- Product A (Nicwell) is more suitable with 78% positive reviews
- Product B (COSLUS) had 52% positive reviews
- Product A had better reviews regarding durability, design, and convenience.
