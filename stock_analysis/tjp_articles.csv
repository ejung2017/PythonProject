Japan's Nikkei 225 hits record high on tariff and rate optimism,"Aug 12, 2025","Japan’s Nikkei 225 stock index hit an all-time record Tuesday, rising as high as ¥42,999.71 — and closing up 2.15%, at ¥42,718.17 — on trade optimism and hope for an interest rate cut in the United States. The surprise rally, which came after months of uncertainty and with the country on the cusp of recession, took the benchmark beyond its July 2024 record of ¥42,426.77. The index is now up almost 18% over the past year.  Stocks took off after Japan and the United States partially addressed their dispute on how to execute a trade deal reached on July 22, with the U.S. agreeing to revise its executive order so that Japan's “reciprocal” tariff is calculated in a way that results in a lower effective rate. U.S. interest rate expectations may have also played a role in the rally. The easing of the tariff shock has been a driver of stock performance, said Nozomi Moriya, managing director and equity strategist at UBS Securities Japan. “The market has been performing more strongly than expected,” Moriya said. “In the global market as well, although there have been concerns over tariffs, there has also been growing anticipation — particularly in the U.S. — of a shift toward monetary easing. I believe this has also been a driver.” Shares in Toyota Motor, Japan’s largest company by market capitalization, rose 2.95% on Tuesday; Honda was up 2.61%, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial rose 4.41%. SoftBank Group shares ended the day 6.92% higher. The yen was steady, at about ¥148.2 to the dollar. The Nikkei 225 had been weighed down by tariff and rate concerns since hitting the last record. In April, it fell as low as ¥30,792.74 after reciprocal tariffs instituted by U.S. President Donald Trump came into effect. Stocks rallied as Trump retreated on implementation and as trade talks between the United States and Japan progressed, with a deal reached on July 22. Last week, Japan said that the United States agreed to change some language in the U.S. executive order on the reciprocal tariffs so that the calculation method for Japan would be in line with the method used for the European Union. In the original executive order, the reciprocal tariff was added to existing tariffs. Under the revised method, the reciprocal tariff — 15% — would operate as a cap of sorts, so tariffs lower than 15% would be taken to 15% and tariffs higher than 15% would not be increased. Recent developments in U.S.-China trade talks might also have contributed to market optimism. On Monday in Washington and Tuesday morning in Beijing, the White House and China’s Commerce Ministry issued a statement to extend the suspension of higher-rate tariffs on each other for another 90 days to allow for further negotiations. Japan's Topix, an index with far more constituents than the Nikkei 225, hit a new record on Friday. Moriya said that while the strong stock prices reflect a degree of optimism now, how the tariffs affect corporate earnings and the overall economy still needs to be monitored. “While I think the uncertainty over the tariff policy itself has come down to some extent, the effects of the tariffs themselves are something that should still be viewed cautiously,” she said. The Nikkei 225 hit 38,957.44 on Dec. 29, 1989, and traded below that level for the next three decades. At one point during that time, it was down by more than 80% from its then-record high. It finally rose to a new high on Feb. 22, 2024."
