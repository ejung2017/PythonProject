       "  'content': 'Bank of Japan watchers brought forward their forecast for when they expect the next interest rate hike, after clarity over trade increased with U.S. President Donald Trump announcing deals, including one with Japan. Some 42% of 45 economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate the move in October, jumping from 32% in the previous survey. Analyst views were last canvassed before the announcement of Japan’s trade pact with the U.S. on July 22, and last week’s BOJ policy decision. Those predicting it in January slightly dropped to a third, while those expecting December doubled to 11%.  No one foresees action at the next meeting in September as their base case, but in a risk scenario, about a quarter said the hike could come as soon as next month. Some 60% said the next hike could come as early as October. The results show that many BOJ watchers are convinced the next increase in borrowing costs is coming closer, even after Gov. Kazuo Ueda signaled caution on Thursday. Analysts pointed to the fact that the BOJ upgraded its inflation forecasts more than expected and raised its risk balance view as evidence the bank is making progress toward a rate move. \"This meeting laid the groundwork for the next hike,” Kento Minami, senior economist at Daiwa Securities, wrote in his survey response. \"Considering upside price risks from food and potentially a weak yen, the condition is suited for another move this year once resilience in corporate activity is confirmed.” The BOJ boosted its price projection sharply to 2.7% for this fiscal year from 2.2% in its quarterly outlook report released Thursday. The bank now sees the risk for prices as generally balanced after seeing only downside risks three months ago. Still, the hawkish signals in the report were toned down during Ueda’s post-meeting news conference. The governor repeatedly highlighted the fact that though a little less than before, uncertainty remains high, and indicated little urgency toward a hike by saying there’s a low risk of falling behind the curve in responding to inflation. Naka Matsuzawa, chief strategist at Nomura Securities, concluded that Ueda’s news conference and the BOJ’s statements were hawkish overall, partly because it’s natural for a central banker to deny the likelihood of falling behind the curve as it’s taboo to be in that position. Some 49% of surveyed economists said that Ueda’s remarks at his news conference were neutral, while 44% said it was dovish. Only 5% said it was hawkish. The comments led the yen to break a key psychological level of ¥150 per dollar, reaching its weakest point since March on Friday. After yen weakness has played a major role in pushing the BOJ toward a policy shift in the past, analysts say it could happen again this time. Some 44% said the possibility is rising for the yen to become a key factor to nudge the bank toward another hike, while 35% didn’t see such an increase. About a fifth said it’s hard to tell. \"If there’s considerable yen depreciation, there’s a risk scenario where the BOJ may opt for an earlier rate hike while highlighting upside movements in underlying inflation,” said Takeshi Yamaguchi, chief Japan economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. In addition to still unclear economic pressure from tariffs and a weak yen, many analysts cited political uncertainty as a potential hurdle for the central bank as it navigates monetary policy. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is facing calls to resign after he faced a historic defeat in the Upper House election on July 20, losing a majority in both houses of parliament for his ruling coalition. Some 71% of the surveyed economists said that there is a risk that Ueda’s board won’t be able to raise rates this year if Ishiba is replaced by a monetary easing advocate, while 19% said that won’t be the case. With Ueda’s repeated message that he wants to parse data broadly and carefully before considering the next hike, some BOJ watchers doubt whether the BOJ will have enough data on hand to say another rate change is warranted this year. \"It takes time to confirm the impact of tariffs in data, even if the effects end up being smaller than expected,” said Shigeto Nagai, former head of BOJ’s international department and currently the head of Oxford Economics in Japan. \"It’s impossible to raise rates again this year.”'}]"

       "  'content': 'Japan’s first interest rate hike in 17 years has failed to deliver the boost to the yen that policymakers had hoped for, with strategists pointing to four key reasons for the currency to remain weak for now. At the top of the list is rates in Japan that remain much lower than the rest of the world, followed by speculation the yen hasn’t weakened fast enough to invite intervention, low market volatility that favors carry trades, and signs the depreciating currency isn’t bolstering exports.  While officials have said the yen isn’t moving in line with fundamentals, and that they will take appropriate steps to stem declines, the currency remains near the three-decade low of ¥151.97 to the dollar set last week. \"The yen is likely to remain weak,” said Daisaku Ueno, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo. \"Despite the rate hike, there’s no prospect to see positive real interest rates in the near term, which makes the appeal of the yen very poor.” After accounting for inflation, Japan’s 10-year yield stands around minus 0.650%, compared with about 2% in the U.S. and 0.27% in Germany. That’s a huge incentive for traders to borrow in yen to invest in high-yielding assets in a strategy known as the carry trade. It’s a headache that just won’t go away for the Japanese government, which has to deal with political fallout of the weak yen pushing up the cost of living for households. While the Bank of Japan is expected to increase borrowing costs further this year, as its major counterparts start to cut interest rates, the exact timing is uncertain, and it will take time to meaningfully narrow the nation’s yawning yield gap with its peers. \"Surplus funds naturally flow from lower-yield places to higher-yielding countries, just like water flows from high to low,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. \"There’s no reason to keep surplus funds here where the policy rate is around zero.” Currency traders are on high alert for possible intervention to support the yen by the Finance Ministry after officials ratcheted up their warnings. Yet the hurdle to leap from words to actions appears to be high. Traders focused on quantifiable guidance from the government’s top currency official, Masato Kanda, are looking to 10-yen moves over one month against the dollar as a key metric. The yen still hasn’t moved that much in recent weeks, according to a gauge that measures the currency’s swings from its highest to lowest against the dollar in a rolling 28-day window. The last time the dollar-yen reached that threshold was in October 2022, when the ministry intervened twice. It’s now less than half that level. Japan is committed to international agreements calling on governments to allow markets to determine exchange rates. But there’s some scope for intervention in response to excessive moves. Volatility has come down in the currency market, boosting the allure of carry trades for investors, who have less cause to worry about market fluctuations wiping out profits. Leveraged funds and asset managers combined pushed up bearish yen bets to the most since April 2022 last month, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. A JPMorgan Chase & Co. gauge of global currency volatility has halved from a recent peak in September 2022. Economics textbooks say that a weak currency should increase exports by making products more affordable abroad, and that the foreign demand will eventually strengthen the currency. But that’s not really happening now in Japan, with an export boost absent. The yen’s nominal effective exchange rate, an indicator of the currency’s strength against those of Japan’s major trading peers, has slumped almost 25% since the end of 2020. But a BOJ gauge for inflation-adjusted exports has fallen 3.3% during the period. That may reflect Japanese companies increasingly producing goods overseas rather than exporting, while fund flows out of the country to seek higher investment returns abroad also are a headwind for the yen. An improved trade balance should be part of the adjustment process for a currency, Steven Englander, head of global G-10 FX research at Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in a research note last week. \"The absence of such an improvement weakens the case for a yen rebound.”'},\n",

       "  'content': \"The outstanding balance of Japanese government debt hit a record high of ¥1.32 quadrillion ($8.67 trillion) at the end of 2024, the Finance Ministry said Monday. The combined balance of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), borrowings and financing bills swelled by ¥7.2 trillion from the end of September last year.  The increase mainly reflected a massive supplementary budget compiled by the government to finance its comprehensive economic policy package late last year. Nearly half of necessary funds were covered by additional JGB issuance. Of the latest total, ordinary JGBs increased by ¥5.69 trillion to ¥1.07 quadrillion and borrowings expanded by ¥2.32 trillion to ¥46.88 trillion, while financing bills decreased by ¥2.7 trillion to ¥97.2 trillion. In its budget bill for the fiscal year from April, the government plans to issue ¥28.65 trillion of new JGBs, the lowest figure in 17 years. Still, debt servicing costs are estimated to hit a record high, reflecting the Bank of Japan's interest rate hikes. With Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba leading a minority government, his administration may face growing pressure from both the ruling and opposition camps to spend more.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Japan may have averted U.S. pressure for a stronger yen in bilateral finance talks on Thursday, but a closer look at officials\\' descriptions of the meeting suggests currencies and the Bank of Japan\\'s interest rate policy may remain key factors in broader trade negotiations. Speaking to reporters after his first face-to-face talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said they did not discuss exchange-rate targets or a framework to manage yen rates.  There was no accusation made by the U.S. that Japan was intentionally weakening the yen, according to a Finance Ministry official who accompanied Kato. But Kato was tight-lipped on the details of the 50-minute meeting with Bessent, which was held on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. When asked whether the U.S. made any specific requests to Japan, Kato said: \"I can\\'t comment because that goes straight into actual discussions.\" A statement released by the U.S. Treasury Department said that Bessent and Kato \"affirmed their intention to continue their ongoing close consultations regarding issues related to exchange rates.\" But it also noted that they \"held productive discussions across a broad range of bilateral issues, including reciprocal trade.\" Kato echoed this, saying Japan and the U.S. will continue close and constructive dialogue on exchange rates \"in relation to the ongoing bilateral trade negotiations\" — language some analysts saw as a sign Washington could make demands on the yen as part of broader trade talks. The meeting preceded top Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa\\'s scheduled visit to Washington next week for a second round of bilateral trade talks that may prove tortuous for the U.S. U.S. President Donald Trump\\'s focus on addressing the trade deficit, and his past remarks criticizing Japan for intentionally maintaining a weak yen, have fueled market expectations that Tokyo will face pressure to strengthen the yen\\'s value against the dollar and give U.S. manufacturers a competitive advantage. \"President Trump strongly believes that Japan and China have been intentionally depreciating their currencies. There\\'s little sign of him changing that view, so markets remain cautious,\" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute. \"If next week\\'s trade negotiations between Akazawa and Bessent do not go well, Washington\\'s attention could turn towards exchange rates again,\" he said. Another key sign was Kato\\'s remark that he explained to Bessent Japan\\'s recent economic developments \"including wage hikes.\" He added that in doing so, he also talked about Japan\\'s \"price developments.\" That suggests discussions may have touched upon Japan\\'s monetary policy, as both wages and prices are key to the timing and pace of further interest rate hikes by the BOJ. Sources have previously said the slow pace at which the BOJ is raising borrowing costs from ultralow levels could come under fire in bilateral trade talks. Steady rises in wages and inflation were key to the BOJ\\'s decision to exit a massive stimulus last year and raise its short-term interest rate to 0.5% in January. With inflation exceeding its 2% target for three consecutive years and big firms continuing to offer bumper pay hikes this year, the BOJ has signaled its readiness to keep hiking rates. But the central bank\\'s rate-hike path has been complicated by Trump\\'s tariffs, which threaten to derail Japan\\'s fragile economic recovery and have prodded analysts to push back the expected timing of the next rate increase. While warning of heightening economic uncertainty, BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda on Thursday repeated the central bank\\'s readiness to keep hiking rates. \"It\\'s notable that Kato and Bessent likely discussed Japan\\'s wage developments,\" said Katsuhiro Oshima, chief economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, adding that Ueda\\'s remarks suggest the BOJ remains on course to hike rates. \"Wage hikes would be a win for Japan\\'s economy, a win for the U.S. from the perspective of exchange rates, a win for Japanese households which will see purchasing power increase, and a win for the BOJ by making it easier to raise rates.\"'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Japan saw the highest number of bankruptcies since 2013 in the six months through September, as companies were increasingly hit by rising costs. Some 4,990 firms went bankrupt in that period, increasing 18.6% from the previous year, according to a report by Teikoku Databank on Tuesday. The number of firms going under in Japan has continued to increase since the second half of the year ending March 2022.  The jump in bankruptcies partly reflects the impact of higher prices, particularly for small companies. A record 472 out of the 4,990 firms cited inflation as the main reason they went bankrupt, the report showed. The country’s key price gauge has stayed at or above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target for over two years, as the weak yen has inflated import costs for everything from food to energy. Construction, manufacturing and retail were among the sectors that had the highest number of cost-driven bankruptcies, according to the report. Beyond rising prices, a record 163 firms cited labor shortages as a reason for their struggles. Japan’s unemployment rate has remained below 3% for over three years — the lowest level among developed economies. The tighter labor market puts pressure on companies to boost salaries to retain their employees, further straining their budgets. While some Japanese companies successfully offered more than a 5% wage increase for their workers in pay negotiations earlier this year, many small and medium sized firms have reported difficulties in following suit. Looking ahead, another potential risk for companies is higher debt-servicing costs following the Bank of Japan’s interest rate hikes in March and July. Some major and regional banks have already announced that they will raise the lending rates on certain short-term loans.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Yen optimism is spreading among hedge funds and asset managers as U.S. tariffs drive haven demand at a time when traders are reassessing the Bank of Japan’s interest rate hike path. Leveraged funds were the most bullish since January 2021 and asset managers increased their long bets in the week through April 8 to the most positive on record in Commodity Futures Trading Commission data going back to 2006. The yen rose 2.3% against the dollar last week and hit its strongest level since September on Friday.  The yen has been one of the best performers against the dollar among its major peers this month as investors anticipate that the trade war launched by President Donald Trump may hurt global economic growth. Speculative traders switched to betting against the dollar and became the most short on the currency since October. \"This is an environment where risk will struggle and that will benefit safe havens like the yen,” said Skylar Montgomery Koning, a currency strategist at Barclays. \"The yen is also attractive from a domestic standpoint, given the Bank of Japan is hiking and there seems to be a policy bias for a stronger currency.” BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda expressed uncertainty about tariffs last week, while also reiterating that the bank will raise rates if its economic outlook is realized. Still, overnight index swaps show a 48% chance of a rate hike by the end of the year, compared with certainty earlier this month before Trump’s tariff announcement hammered global markets.'},\n",

Shaun McKenna 00:09 Welcome to Deep Dive from The Japan Times, I’m Shaun McKenna. Last week saw the return of the Sapporo Snow Festival, which took place between Feb. 4 and 11 in the capital of Japan’s northern Hokkaido region. And it was quite the return, the event drew 2.4 million visitors with organizers just ecstatic that attendance had recovered to pre-pandemic levels. It was the 74th edition of the Snow Festival, so let’s hope next year will be an even bigger success as it will be the 75th edition. But Hokkaido is more than just the ice sculptures in Sapporo, it’s got tons of animals! Maybe, too many animals. On today’s episode we will talk to Justin Randall, a freelance writer based in eastern Hokkaido, about the hunting culture in that region before going a little more in depth into the people that actually live there. After that, Alyssa I. Smith will join me to talk about a flurry of music news that happened over the past weekend, including a visit by pop superstar Taylor Swift and the deaths of some truly legendary Japanese musicians, conductor Seiji Ozawa and Can vocalist Damo Suzuki. Hey Justin, welcome to Deep Dive. Justin Randall 01:22 Thanks, Shaun. Shaun McKenna 01:23 So at the start of the month, you wrote a piece for us titled “Hokkaido hunters say more firepower means more humane kills.” What sparked the idea to write that article? Justin Randall 01:33 Oh, yeah. So I live in Kushiro, which is in the eastern end of Hokkaido. And from my time living here, I know a few different hunters so I started looking into the culture and the rules about it. And I know from this podcast that you have done some episodes with Alex Martin, on the increase in animal population in rural areas. Shaun McKenna 01:51 Yeah, last year's phenomenon was the urban bear. But a bunch of other animals are finding their way into urban areas, yeah? Justin Randall 01:58 Yeah. So while Kushiro is a big city, it has around 165,000 people in the last census count, it is isolated from the rest of Hokkaido. It's out in this pocket by itself. And the area is seeing an increase in deer each year. And according to the government statistics from 2022, there was 720,000 deer in Hokkaido. And they caused damage of around ¥4.8 billion that year, which is around US$35 million, according to 2022 rates. So for my piece on hunting, I focused specifically on Ezo deer, which is the largest subspecies of Japanese deer, and they're big and brown, really rugged in the winter, but in the summer, they have these really clear white spots on their backs, and the mature stags can reach around 200 kilograms. They also have straighter antlers than normal deer, and those antlers are really really big, which can reach around 90 centimeters in length. Shaun McKenna 02:57 Yeah, I've seen a picture of the Ezo deer and the antlers really do stand out. Do the deer have any natural predators? Justin Randall 03:04 Well, of course, there's the Hokkaido brown bear, which is called Ezo higuma, and bear sightings jumped just over 4,000 last year. So another predator would be humans and whether that's from hunting or really unlucky drivers. In fact, in the subprefecture of Kushiro, we saw over 4,500 deer-related car accidents in 2022. And that's 13% of all Hokkaido. So not quite unusual to see road signs out here that caution drivers to watch out. And lately, there has been some crashes in urban areas. Then around the schools, when the students are going home, we need to alert the kids sometimes that there's like this roaming pack of deer on their route home. There's always that worry that if the student started the deer or if the deer started the students that there'll be a traffic accident, right. OK. Another cool little population statistic is that in 2017, there was 660,000 deer in Hokkaido. Shaun, do you want to guess how many elementary school students there were in Hokkaido? Shaun McKenna 04:07 I have no clue. Justin Randall 04:10 So compared to the 666,000 deer, there was 250,000 elementary school students in Hokkaido. Shaun McKenna 04:17 So every kid in Hokkaido basically gets two deer each, right? Justin Randall 04:27 Yeah, that's how it looks. Shaun McKenna 04:17 So you also mentioned hunting in there. Where are you from, originally? Justin Randall 04:27 I'm originally from Tennessee, but I've actually never hunted there. Shaun McKenna 04:30 OK, but you went out hunting with two Kushiro residents for your piece? Why don't you tell us what that was like? Justin Randall 04:36 Yeah, so it kind of starts a little bit before that. My first encounter with hunting in Japan was when we helped my friend move from the city of Kushiro to this small town out just north of our city. And when we arrived we're walking around the City Hall and all these like older guys were sitting there chain smoking and holding guns. They just come back from a hunt. I was like a really shocked Considering, like Japanese gun laws, it's a real like surreal experience to see it's kind of open carry like that. And so for the article, I had a chance to go hunting with this guy named Eric Rose. And he later introduced me to a woman named Naoko Motooka. Naoko lives and actually works in Kushiro. And she started hunting about 10 years ago. And that was after another hunter gave her some deer meat and she was like, “Wow, this is really delicious. I'd like to be able to try to get my own.” But Eric grew up hunting in America and when he moved out here, he sought how to get a license. So the way that they hunt is really interesting. Naoko actually uses skis in the winter. So the snow is so deep that the snowshoes are kind of ineffective, and they’ll alert the deer to you know how loud your footsteps are. So she has these really cool traditional skis with like seal skin on the bottom of them, and she kind of zips in and out in between trees, real silent, very ninja-like, and she carries bear spray along with her. The day that we went out, we saw a bunch of other hunters out on the roads, which if you ever see like working-man trucks in the forest out in the middle of Hokkaido at six o'clock in the morning, that's probably what they're up to. So Eric Rose teaches in Kushiro and this is actually my fourth time going hunting with him when we actually finally caught a deer. Really interesting experience because we're on the top of this mountain, but, you know, some kilometers away, we could hear the boom of artillery from the JSDF proving grounds that are up here in Hokkaido. Shaun McKenna 06:31 Right. That's the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, yeah? Justin Randall 06:35 Yeah, yeah. So we hear the artillery going out as we're walking around in the woods, which for me, I grew up in Tennessee near a military base. That was kind of a weird nostalgia. And when we got out of the car, which is this big, kind of 4x4, because at that point, the snow was so deep, we look up and we see this tree next to us that's just been carved by these big brown bears. We make it down into this valley, and we end up crossing this frozen creek. There wasn't really a lot of deer out and the snow was just a little bit hard. You can really hear that crunch of your feet as you walk through it. So we crossed this creek and it helps kind of silence our footsteps a little bit more, it’s a little bit softer snow, and right as we get over the creek bank. Shaun, do you know what a sound a deer makes? Shaun McKenna 07:19 I mean, I've only seen “Bambi,” so I guess, “Mom? Mom?” Justin Randall 07:24 It’s not anything like that. It's really interesting. If you weren't thinking about it, it actually sounds like a whistle, or like a bird almost like this chirp, real loud, right? So as we cross this creek bank, we hear this chirp and we think, “Oh man, like the deer has seen us, it's now going to be running off into the woods, we're not gonna be able to get a deer.” So what actually happened was, is that this deer did see us and it started running away. But there was two other deer that didn't see us and they stood up, and they're looking around because they've been alerted by their friend. And Eric spotted them before they did us. And he signaled me to kind of stand back, I got down on my knees and waited, and it was real quiet. And then bang, we got the deer. And after that, we prepared it. And we buried the carcass of took about 9 kilograms of meat back out with us. Shaun McKenna 08:14 Why did you bury the carcass? Justin Randall 08:16 So as I mentioned earlier, the bear is the other big predator. And when we were preparing the meat, I asked Eric, I was like, “Hey, that was a loud gunshot. Does that scare away the bear?” And he's like, “No, actually, the bears have gotten kind of wise to it. So if they hear a gunshot in the woods, oh, well, there's going to be a dead deer there.” So the bears are kind of attracted to that sound now. So we buried the carcass in order to prevent birds or other predators from kind of congregating around that spot. And that's kind of required by the Hunters’ Association. Shaun McKenna 08:48 OK, so did Eric say whether it was easy for him to get a gun license? Justin Randall 08:53 So, as you may know, Japan has really, really strict gun laws. And because of that it doesn't have the same gun culture that America does. Japan does have one of the lowest rates of gun ownership throughout the world. But as of 2021, the Japan National Police Agency counted 177,000 firearms licensed in the country, and 87,000 people, mostly hunters, were permitted to carry them. So Japan basically banned citizens from having guns and specifically possessing, carrying, buying, selling or importing firearms. All of that's illegal — unless they have a gun license. So getting licensed is not particularly easy. You have to be over 20, pass a written test, and complete a certain amount of practice shooting sessions before taking the final shooting test. Then you go on to the last boss, and that's a lengthy screening process with your prefectural police. The whole process costs roughly ¥60,000. And then that screening process is a deep background check. They review your criminal record, personal relationships, involvement in organized crime, and they give you a psychiatric test and a drug test. And for foreigners, specifically, since they don't have those records for your whole life, they're going to reach out to your home country and do a background check through there. And if you make it through all of that, you're awarded with a license, but you have to renew every three years and the police inspect your gun ammunition and where you store it at once a year. Shaun McKenna 10:22 Huh, OK. I don't know much about guns myself. When you get your gun license in Japan, what kinds of guns does that cover? Justin Randall 10:28 So there's shotguns and there's rifles in Japan. Shotguns come in two categories: They're either smoothbore or they're rifled. Smoothbore shotguns don't have these grooves that cause the bullet to spin, but rifled shotguns have these grooves. Rifled shotguns are shotguns — they're not rifles. Rifles are a separate category, and this is where it gets kind of difficult. In Japan, you have to have a 10-year waiting period from the time you get your license to when you're able to use a rifle. But most hunters here in Hokkaido start off using these rifled shotguns, which in Japanese is called “hafu raifuru.” Shaun McKenna 11:07 Right, so the terminology is kind of tricky but you basically are dividing them into two categories. There's the first category, which is things you can get after you get your license. So that would be the shotguns and the shotguns that are rifled. And then you also have a category of rifles, which you can only get 10 years later, is that correct? Justin Randall 11:29 Correct, and the reason for that is rifles are much more accurate at distance and the bullets travel a lot faster. Shaun McKenna 11:36 Right. So also potentially more dangerous, I guess. So last month, the National Police Agency also announced that it was looking at changing requirements for gun ownership. Can you explain a little bit what's going on with that? Justin Randall 11:49 Yeah, it's really difficult right now, we mentioned previously the 10-year waiting period, and in that 10-year waiting period, you have to have a spotless record. So there's all these little hoops or hurdles that you have to go through. You have to have all of your ammunition counted properly, you have to have all of your shots reported. And if you have any infractions on your license, you can’t upgrade to a rifle after 10 years. So in response to the Nagano shooting, where two police officers were killed, and potentially a half rifle, one of those rifled shotguns, was used in that, the National Police Agency is wanting to put the rifled shotguns on the same level as a rifle. So that impacts the hunters in many ways. So these rifled shotguns, while they don't have 100% of the barrel rifle, they have about 50% of a barrel rifle, which is unique to Japan. Most of these rifled shotguns are used in Hokkaido specifically because of the distance and the type of game that they're hunting. So these new barriers to entry can prove to be an issue, as most of the hunters are, are aging out. And not a lot of new hunters are coming in. So it becomes a conservation issue for deer. Shaun McKenna 12:59 Gotcha. So these newer hunters don't have access to the most accurate guns, the rifles. And they rely on the shotguns that are rifled for better firepower. But if that's something that's taken away, they'll be left with the less-accurate style of shotgun that is less likely to score a clean hit when it comes to hunting. Justin Randall 13:18 Yeah, so the way that Eric described it was like shooting a knuckleball. If you're shooting a shotgun that's unrifled, that’s smoothbore, at distance, those bullets — the shot, not bullets, the shot — is going to drop a lot quicker, over a shorter distance and it becomes a lot harder to hit a vital shot on these deer and that leads to animal suffering. Shaun McKenna 13:38 I think you mentioned in the article that there could be a possible exemption for Hokkaido. Justin Randall 13:44 Yeah, so like I said, the game that is being hunted out here is a lot different than what's being hunted in Honshu. And in Honshu it's a lot of boar hunting, and a lot of bird hunting. But in Hokkaido, it's deer and bear hunting. Shaun, do you know the bear rhyme? Shaun McKenna 13:58 I don't know, sorry. Justin Randall 14:00 So if you see a bear, there's obviously three types of bears: If it's black, you fight back. If it's brown, lay down. If it's white, say good night. Polar bears are the most dangerous. Shaun McKenna 14:10 Really, polar bears are the most dangerous? I don't know, maybe it's because of climate change that they're so angry? Justin Randall 14:17 Yeah, so they're the only bears, the polar bears, that see humans as food. And brown bears are really territorial, whereas black bears are mostly scavengers. So black bears are scared of humans, but the brown bears if they feel threatened, they're going to attack and if you see a polar bear ... it was nice knowing you. So Hokkaido has brown bears, whereas Honshu has black bears, that provides a challenge. So hunters have to get closer to the bears if they don't have these half-rifled shotguns, which might lead to more bad interactions where hunters are either getting injured or getting killed. So hunters in Hokkaido are really hoping that the status quo maintains itself where these rifled shotguns are able to be used at the start of their hunting license, rather than after that 10-year waiting period, and with more firepower, that means that the hunters are gonna be able to defend themselves against bear attacks. And, whenever they hit a deer, there's gonna be less of a chance of deer just being wounded and the deer running off and it's hurting for the rest of its remaining life. But with deer having these vital shots, they're gonna die a lot quicker, and that's gonna be a lot less pain and suffering for that animal. Shaun McKenna 15:35 Justin, how long have you been living in Kushiro? Justin Randall 15:38 I've been living in Kushiro since August 2019. Shaun McKenna 15:42 Most people who come here wind up in bigger cities like Tokyo or Kyoto. And it's also where all the tourists seem to be going even though the travel agencies in the rest of the country are trying to get tourists cash as well. Give us a pitch as to why it's worth visiting or even living in the far flung reaches of Japan. Justin Randall 15:59 So Kushiro is home to some of the most incredible nature that I've ever seen, and when you get outside of the city, there's this expansive marshland. It's one of the largest wetlands in all of Japan. And there's a bunch of different volcanic national parks nearby, and we're in close proximity to the famous Shiretoko Peninsula. When you get outside of the city, and you get up into the mountains, you can have these really expensive road trips, and it kind of reminds me of living back in America. And Kushiro is kind of an interesting place, remarkably young city. And it was only gaining city status in 1922, which, compared to Hokkaido itself, which is also young, which was colonized in the 1860s to like the 1880s Kushiro kind of seems like a world apart from the rest of Japan. Shaun McKenna 16:48 A big theme that continues to pop up on our podcast is depopulation. And I happen to know from your writing that this is affecting Kushida as well, right? Justin Randall 16:58 Yeah, so Kushiro only becoming a city in 1922 became a really powerful city, one of the largest ports in Japan following the World War II, as well as a coal mining and paper producing town. But all of that kind of turned out to be really unsustainable. So when you come to Kushiro, you're going to see a really unfortunate scene, there's kind of this hollowed-out central business district. And a lot of these buildings that popped up during the bubble economy became untenable and are now kind of just fading away in plain sight. So Kushiro tried to pivot to tourism, but with like Corona, it's kind of this one two punch that's really set things behind. I once saw a Reddit comment that compared downtown Kushiro to “The Walking Dead,” which is really unfortunate, because it's a really special place to be. Yeah, and a special place to a lot of people. And it has a lot of really great summer tourism. It's one of the coldest cities year round, and it gets about 150 days of fog per year. And then when you get outside of the city, there's all these different four season adventure tourism activities that you can do. Shaun McKenna 18:08 This weekend, you will be coming out with a story about the people of Kushiro. And you've spoken to many people for our 20 Questions section, too. But for this weekend's article, you chose five people in particular to kind of symbolize the issues that Kushiro is facing. Can you give us a preview of what those are? Justin Randall 18:27 Yeah, so I talked with five different people. The first being a rock and roll like punk rock, live-house bar owner; as well as a tattoo artist; a hairstylist; a Shinto priest and a gentleman who makes tonkori, which are guitars that the Ainu used long ago. So one thing I did notice with the story that I'm writing is this common theme of younger people who have left Kushiro and decided to come back and in hopes of kind of saving the little area within this town. And specifically, one person I spoke to was Yoshifumi Kikuchi, and he's a 37-year-old Shinto priest. He's one of the priests at Itsukushima Shrine, which is in this area of Kushiro called Motomachi. And he founded this youth association called the Motomachi Youth Association in 2015. And the event that we highlighted specifically was this race called Moko Race. Shaun McKenna 19:20 OK, what's the Moko Race? Justin Randall 19:22 So much like with all Shinto shrines in Japan, a lot of them are on these hills, a little bit elevated from the street level that you might find them on. And the participants go there to the main building, they're divided into teams and then they head to the bottom of the hill where there's this really large torii gate. On their backs, they're carrying these wooden backpacks filled with weights and seaweed. Shaun McKenna 19:20 Are the weights just to make it harder? Justin Randall 19:22 Yeah, exactly. Shaun McKenna 19:20 What about the seaweed? Justin Randall 19:22 So that's an offering for God when you get back up the hill. So on the sound of a starter pistol, everyone sprints back up from the torii gate to the main building. And, some people, they take it really seriously, and some people kind of just laugh. And there's a few that even fell along the way. It's kind of like this physical fitness challenge you'd have to do in high school gym class or something. But the first person who would get to the top had to sound this drum, and in the first part of the race, they would advance to the next stage. But then there's this final race where whoever wins for that category is going to get blessed with good luck for the rest of the year. Right. Shaun McKenna 20:26 Right, did you try the Moko Race? Justin Randall 20:28 I didn't, I do plan on joining next year so ...wish me luck. Shaun McKenna 20:32 OK, good luck. Justin Randall 20:34 So, the reason I bring it up is that while some traditions are dying, there are people who are ready to start new ones and maybe wind up being more relevant to younger people today. This shrine Itsukushima Shrine is surrounded by all these abandoned homes. And because of that Kikuchi wants to kind of bring back this vibrant community and have a lot of young people say, “Oh, like I want to live in this part of Kushiro,” so he's kind of seeing it in a different way than normal. He's younger, really focused on using like YouTube and social media and creating these, like, really cool advertisements for the city. And the group's effort, which they kind of dubbed the Motomachi Model, focuses on this advertisement of this area as a nice, easy, safe place to live. And then from there, they want to revitalize the existing community. So that comes in a few different ways. There's history lessons for people to kind of gather around that they can learn more about this area of town. And that even extends to some of the schools where they have these quizzes for students in their social studies class, where they can learn more about these places that they're walking by whenever they're going home from school. And in the evening. They have these nomikais but they also have these, like evening runs, and they have these events where everyone can hang out with, with the larger ones being these like community luncheons, where everyone gets together and has a big meal together. Shaun McKenna 22:01 So I think like a lot of people are trying to do that within their communities across Japan? Justin Randall 22:05 Yeah, it seems to be a common theme seems to be different from place to place. But I think is interesting, because these people see that this area, their slice of the world, is worth saving, and they want to preserve that tradition. But maybe the next step is probably looking at more practical things that a town might need in order to entice people to come back. And what you need to see is a change of mindset. And I'm not quite sure that every community in Japan is ready for that yet. Shaun McKenna 22:33 Well on that, actually, something I tend to read about is these small Japanese towns, they are kind of picky about the people that they want to move into their community. We recently carried a story about a survey by a research institute at Taisho University taking of 59 cities and towns that host a larger than 5% population of foreign nationals. And that particular survey didn't include Tokyo or any of the country's 20 big major cities. So 83.8% of respondents said they don't have regular exchanges with the foreign nationals who live alongside them. And out of 16.2% that said they do, 39.7% of those said that they are colleagues with non-Japanese people, followed by 32.5% who said that they're neighbors with them, and 21.6% who said that they have foreign friends. But here's the kicker, so one thing I think is, you know, you don't have to be friends with non Japanese people in your community. And you know, I don't know your situation. So I'm not going to judge, but 54.5% of those surveyed cited concerns about non-Japanese people moving into their community, and causing increased friction or the deterioration of social order. And, like, I would think that more interaction would lead to less deterioration of social order myself, but you are just one person, but you live in a town that is experiencing depopulation. So is there an effort to bring maybe more non-Japanese people like you into the town? Justin Randall 24:12 Yeah it’s kind of a mixed bag. But the piece that I mentioned coochie, he doesn't have a problem with it. He's younger, he's traveled abroad, he has a lot of foreign friends. And I think he can imagine a different future for Japan. But again, there's that obvious anxiety between some of the older generation or maybe some people who haven't really had the internationalization. Personally, and I think this is for anyone listening who is thinking to come and live in Japan or perhaps even join the JET Programme. My experience has been wonderful. Even through COVID I got here and then right away it started. Of course, it's not without his ups and downs, and you know, you're gonna bump into people and have that friction. But if we remember that we're in control of ourselves and be kind to all the people that we meet around us, we're gonna have those authentic experiences that are gonna have benefits both ways. Shaun McKenna 25:06 All right, well, Justin, thank you for coming on Deep Dive. Thanks, Shaun. [music playing] She came, she saw she slayed. I'm back with Japan Times culture editor Alyssa I. Smith, and of course I'm referring to Taylor Swift, who played a string of four nights at Tokyo Dome last week. Alyssa, it was quite a hurricane of coverage. Alyssa Smith 25:31 Yes it was. And we still have some more coming out. Shaun McKenna 25:34 Well, what were some of the pieces that we carried in Japan Times then? Alyssa Smith 25:39 Well, we had a pretty large review by Alan Richarz that outlined some highlights from the opening show, including Taylor speaking a little bit of Japanese here and there. All of her fans are probably going to know what went down, but the review mentioned her playing the song “Dear Reader” for the first time live. Now this is The Eras Tour, so the show itself goes through stages, or eras, of Taylor's career according to the album she released. The debut song popped up in a section of the show called “Surprise Songs,” which frankly, I think more artists should be doing, especially bigger names, just to switch up the setlist on your world tour, you know? Shaun McKenna 26:18 Sure, I know. What were some of the other big stories that accompanied Taylor's visit? Alyssa Smith 26:24 Of course, there were plenty of stories based on “Swiftonomics.” This is the economic impact of having Taylor play in your city. We had Yukana Inoue write about it, and she reported that the economic impact research laboratory was estimating that the impact on Tokyo was going to be around ¥34.1 billion. So that's $230 million dollars, U.S. Shaun McKenna 26:48 Wow, that includes merch as well as tickets, yeah? Alyssa Smith 26:51 Yes, it does. And since Taylor's only Asia dates are in Tokyo, and then six dates in Singapore at the start of March, it meant people flew in from all over the world to see the Japan shows. Patrick St. Michel wrote about the influx of foreign tourists. You could even spot them around Tokyo last weekend. So, “Swifties,” which is the name of her fans, wear these homemade friendship bracelets that they swap at the shows, so that was one way to spot them in the wild. Shaun McKenna 27:21 I guess. The low yen also made things really easy to kind of combine the show with a visit to Japan right now? Alyssa Smith 27:26 Exactly. Shaun McKenna 27:28 I also noticed that Motoko Rich from the New York Times reported on some discontent among Japanese fans at the Swift shows. What was that about? Alyssa Smith 27:36 So, Motoko Rich and Kiuko Notoya wrote a piece titled “Welcome to Japan, Taylor Swift Fans. Please remain seated as you cheer.” It was a good piece, but I think the headline may have been slightly off, which isn't Motoko’s fault. In the piece, she reported that some fans rushed forward from their seats when Taylor appeared on stage. So, Japanese fans largely had to follow rules. And they were a bit upset about what they perceived as unruly behavior by the non Japanese fans. Shaun McKenna 28:07 Right. So I guess the headline should have been, maybe please remain at your seats as you cheer. Alyssa Smith 28:13 Right. I noticed some backlash on Twitter ... I mean, X. Sorry. Shaun McKenna 28:17 I'm still doing it too. Alyssa Smith 28:21 ...and a lot of it had to do with people only reading the headline and relaying their own experiences at Japanese concerts. Shaun McKenna 28:28 Yeah, I kind of saw this so-called backlash too. So actually, we went to cover Rock in Japan Festival, this was before the pandemic, it's a huge outdoor festival in the summer, and when you arrived at the front gate, you would see a list of rules that the organizers want you to follow. And one of those rules was you get this assigned spot in the crowd and you're asked to stay there. This kind of thing happens at Japanese shows. It doesn't happen at every Japanese show. So you know, for example, Fuji Rock, which we've both been to, and is more popular with non Japanese fans, you can kind of like rush the stage if you want to. Or you can just approach the stage basically, right, you don't have an assigned spot. And I know that with some of these kinds of outdoor festivals that have these rules, some Japanese bands have actually complained about the policy from the stage while they're playing. I think it was like One OK Rock or Hi-Standard that did that at Rock in Japan. But yeah, it's kind of more imposed by venues just because they don't want anyone to get injured. Alyssa Smith 29:34 Yeah and there are shows where Japanese fans wave and cheer. At idle shows, though sometimes there is etiquette that crowds in Japan follow. No pictures is another one. The rules say no pictures and if you're in the crowd and try to sneak one these loyal fans will call you out and tell you to erase it. Shaun McKenna 29:51 You know, I remember that happening to me. The person in the crowd told me that the artist makes their money from selling pictures to fame. So, like taking a picture would be in effect stealing. And it was a blurry picture on an iPhone but I'm not going to argue. Alyssa Smith 30:12 Right so this seating kerfuffle happened at Taylor Swift. I can't say if it happened at Ed Sheeran or Queen who also came to Tokyo Dome recently. But it's an interesting little insight into some fan culture here. You know, even at some rock shows Japanese fans don't make much noise at all because they're listening so closely to the music, which can be unnerving sometimes for some international acts. In almost every interview we've done with a foreign band, they'll tell us how polite everyone is in Japan. They're just listening very intently. You know, we've got a lot of sound buffs here. Shaun McKenna 30:50 While you're here. Just also want to note that we lost to Japanese music greats this weekend. Seiji Ozawa and Damo Suzuki. Alyssa Smith 30:59 Yeah, we are currently working on a piece about Damo Suzuki, who was a member of the influential group Can. People can check out their track “Vitamin C,” and trust me, you've heard it before. The Ozawa news came Friday night and The Japan Times, you included Shaun, has done a number of pieces on him throughout his career. Shaun McKenna 31:20 I was able to see him do a practice session for kids in Matsumoto for his festival there, actually. Alyssa Smith 31:25 That's nice. I grew up playing in ensembles and orchestras, so he was definitely a figure I've been very aware of my whole life. So in addition to working with orchestras around the world, Ozawa was the music director at the Boston Symphony Orchestra for 29 years. He was one of the most celebrated conductors worldwide in recent times. So we had our classical music writer, Chiho Iuchi write about her experiences interviewing him. We also have a really good piece by Dan Szpara, who snapped a wonderful picture of Ozawa sticking out his tongue. Shaun McKenna 32:02 Yeah, that was actually a shot that I commissioned him to do. And when we saw it, it was just like, “Oh, this is such a good shot.” And then his PR team thought it didn't make him look dignified, and so they were really worried about it. But just to describe it for people, he's wearing red, it's kind of like he's sitting in front of a very old piano. There's a story behind the piano. It looks a little bit like that famous photo of Albert Einstein sticking his tongue out. But it was like, kind of characterizes his kind of sense of humor, in a way that he kind of ... you didn't get to see it, I guess fairly often, but yeah. Alyssa Smith 32:37 Yeah. It's all there in that photo. Shaun McKenna 32:41 Well, both Ozawa and Suzuki left impressive legacies, and I'll put links to any of the stories that we have in the show notes, Alyssa, thanks very much for coming on the pod. Alyssa Smith 32:51 Thank you, Shaun. Shaun McKenna 32:51 My thanks again to Alyssa and Justin for joining me on Deep Dive. We'll put links to the stories in the show notes. Deep Dive producer Dave Cortez. Dave Cortez 33:03 Hey, Shaun. Shaun McKenna 32:05 My condolences on the Super Bowl. Dave Cortez 33:07 You know, I am a 49ers fan and I can't even think about it right now, to be honest with you. Shaun McKenna 33:11 Well, you know who did win, aside from the Kansas City Chiefs — the National Football League. So, Super Bowl LVIII was the most-watched TV program in U.S. history, and the game, on was it Sunday, Feb. 11? Averaged 123.4 million viewers across television and streaming platforms. Some of that had to be Taylor Swift's involvement, right? Dave Cortez 33:31 You know, at the sports bar I was at it was really funny to see every time she was put on the screen, the entire room just cheered like mad men. These are diehard football fans, so she definitely had an impact. Shaun McKenna 33:43 Yeah, that's awesome. But it's incredible that her involvement in something just kind of ups the attention that much. Before coming to Japan, she was one of the main draws at this year's Grammy Awards, which also saw over 17 million viewers tune in. And if you compare that to other award ceremonies, like the Emmys, the Emmys saw, like a record low of 4.3 million viewers. But yeah, she's kind of like bringing crowds with her. Dave Cortez 34:08 Well that can only mean one thing, Shaun. The Oscars on March 11 are probably already emailing Taylor Swift’s people right now to get her to the show. Shaun McKenna 34:16 Yeah, I'm sure everyone in Hollywood is thinking that now. Some of the other stories we have on the Japan Times website just now: Japan’s latest growth figures confirm that its economy has dropped from the third-largest to the fourth-largest in the world, officially being overtaken by Germany. Reporting from Erica Yokoyama of Bloomberg notes that Japan’s economy unexpectedly contracted for a second quarter at the end of 2023, dipping into a recession and clouding the Bank of Japan’s interest rate policy going forward. Part of that is down to a weak yen, which went past the ¥150 per dollar mark on Wednesday — that was the first time since November, glad I took my holiday in December.

Deep Dive from the Japan Times is produced by Dave Cortez. Our outgoing music is by Oscar Boyd, and the theme tune is by Japanese musician LLLL. I’m Shaun McKenna, thanks and podtsukaresama.\"}]"

       "  'content': 'The Bank of Japan held its benchmark interest rate steady and raised its inflation outlook more than expected in a sign it may be closer to a rate hike, while continuing to warn that it’s still assessing the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The BOJ kept the overnight call rate at 0.5% at the end of a two-day policy meeting in a unanimous vote, according to a statement Thursday. All 56 surveyed economists forecast the decision.  The nine-member board boosted its median inflation projection for the current fiscal year in its quarterly economic outlook report to 2.7% from 2.2%, reflecting persistent increases in food prices. It also slightly raised its forecasts for fiscal year 2026 and 2027, while bringing up its economic growth view a tad for this year. Economists had expected a shift to 2.5% for the current year’s inflation forecast. While the array of changes in the outlook suggested Gov. Kazuo Ueda’s board is closer to its next rate hike, the central bank also avoided dropping any clear hints as to the exact timing. Officials likely need time to gauge how U.S. tariffs will affect Japan’s economy and global commerce, even after a deal was struck between the U.S. and Japan. Markets took the BOJ’s decision in stride. The yen extended gains slightly against the dollar in the immediate aftermath of the decision and then oscillated in a relatively narrow range as Ueda spoke. Stocks closed higher, with little discernible impact from the decision. Japanese government bond futures swung from a small loss to a small gain. \"The BOJ’s upward revision of its price outlook does make it seem like a rate hike is coming closer,” said Hiroki Shimazu, chief strategist at MCP Asset Management. \"At the same time, in the latest outlook report, the bank is also talking about an expected slowdown.” Those issues are key for markets, with the yen hovering near its weakest since early April and within easy reach of the psychological level of 150 to the dollar. Meanwhile, bond yields have been pushing higher in recent months, with the moves in longer-maturity debt spilling over into global markets. The BOJ gathering concluded just hours after the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate steady and Chair Jerome Powell tempered expectations for a rate cut in September. The BOJ revised its assessment of the risk balance for inflation in its outlook report by saying risks were generally balanced. It only cited downside risks for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 in the report three months ago. That’s another sign the board is looking at the potential case for higher rates down the road. The BOJ also softened its characterization of uncertainty over trade in its outlook report summary to show it’s no longer \"extremely” high, and reiterated its intention to raise rates if conditions allow. Earlier the Fed held its benchmark interest rate steady, with Powell citing \"many, many uncertainties” impeding a move as Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman dissented by voting for a quarter-point cut. Japan’s government struck a trade deal with Washington on July 22 that lowered tariffs on U.S. imports of Japanese autos and most other goods to 15%. That pact reduced a key source of uncertainty for policymakers, allowing them to now focus on measuring the effects of tariffs. \"There have been positive developments in trade and other policies, such as negotiations between Japan and the United States resulting in an agreement,” the BOJ’s latest outlook report said. \"That said, high uncertainties remain regarding negotiations between jurisdictions and the impact of trade and other policies on economic activity and prices at home and abroad.” Provided there’s no change to the levies, BOJ officials expect they will have enough data by the of the year, at the latest, to be able to consider whether a rate hike would be appropriate, sources said earlier last month. The BOJ’s upgrade to the inflation outlook comes as persistently high living costs have made Japan among the most inflationary nations in the Group of Seven. Rising prices for food, especially rice, have driven the gains, compelling the bank to examine that impact on underlying inflation trends.'},\n",
       " {'date': 'Jul 3, 2025',\n",
       "  'content': 'The Bank of Japan’s rate hike cycle will resume after \"only” a temporary pause, policy board member Hajime Takata warned, keeping his hawkish tone even after U.S. President Donald Trump clouded the economic outlook by threatening to impose tariffs on Japanese goods higher than those previously touted. \"I believe that the bank is currently only pausing its policy interest rate hike cycle and should continue to make a gear shift after a certain period of ‘wait and see,’” Takata said Thursday in a speech to local business leaders in Mie Prefecture.  Takata’s remarks made it clear that the BOJ is continuing to look for further opportunities to raise rates even after the prospects for a trade deal with the U.S. appeared to recede after Trump floated the idea of increasing tariffs to 35%, compared with a previous plan to hike an across-the-board duty to 24% starting next week. Takata, considered a hawkish member of the central bank\\'s board, said authorities \"may need to nimbly shift back to the rate hike cycle in response to policy changes” in the U.S. His remarks indicate there’s still a chance of another hike this year depending on the effects of the levies. Given high uncertainties regarding U.S. policies, \"the bank is required to conduct monetary policy in a more flexible manner without being too pessimistic,” he said. Takata was speaking as Japan’s pace of inflation has stayed elevated at the highest level among Group of Seven major industrial nations. A key measure for the cost of living hit a fresh two-year high in May, and a record of the BOJ’s meeting last month reflected a shared awareness among officials that price growth is a little stronger than expected. \"Japan’s economy is at a stage where the price stability target is close to being achieved,” Takata said. \"The key to a further gear shift in monetary policy is the sustainability of positive corporate behavior.” BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda has repeatedly said underlying inflation remains below the bank’s 2% target and he wants to see the trend rise before raising rates again. He also wants to confirm the likely magnitude of the economic impact from U.S. trade policies. In previous speeches, Takata, a veteran economist and former bond analyst, has noted the need to raise borrowing costs as economic activity improves. Remarks of that nature in the weeks running up to the BOJ’s historic end of its massive monetary easing program in March 2024 helped investors prepare for the coming shift. \"Even if the economy remains robust at the moment, the longer concerns about tariffs remain, the greater the downward pressure on economic activity could become,” Takata said Thursday. The BOJ will deliver its next policy decision on July 31, with more than 90% of BOJ watchers surveyed last month expecting the benchmark rate to be left at 0.5%.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The Bank of Japan is on course to raise rates past the 0.5% barrier, unbroken for almost 30 years, if policymakers become confident that the country will achieve 2% inflation stably and sustainably. The central bank\\'s board voted Friday to increase its target for its short-term policy rate to around 0.5% from around 0.25%.  If the BOJ continues to raise the rate, it will become close to the so-called neutral rate of interest, which neither stimulates nor cools the economy. The BOJ expects to raise the policy rate to the neutral rate, believed to be between 1% and 2.5%, by the end of fiscal 2026. A senior BOJ official has said that the central bank should raise the policy rate to at least 1%. However, determining the actual neutral rate is difficult. BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda has said that the question of when to stop raising rates remains a major challenge. The BOJ\\'s policy rate last reached 0.5% roughly 18 years ago, arriving at the level after the central bank raised it by 0.25 percentage point each in July 2006 and February 2007, following its lifting of quantitative monetary easing in March 2006. However, the BOJ resumed quantitative easing following the global financial crisis of 2008, bringing interest rates below zero. There is scarce empirical data on how the Japanese economy would react to sustained interest rate increases, so the BOJ needs to make any decision while closely monitoring economic and price reactions. Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, estimated that Japan\\'s neutral rate of interest is just shy of 1%, given the country\\'s low potential growth rate. The BOJ \"will have to steer policy carefully, so that there are no negative effects on the economy and prices,\" Kiuchi said, predicting that the bank will increase the policy rate to 0.75% in the second half of 2025 before ending rate increases.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The Dow Jones Industrial Average\\nticked up Wednesday after the release of more encouraging U.S. inflation data. The 30-stock Dow climbed 242 points, or 0.61%, to end the day at 40,008.39. The S&P 500\\ninched up 0.38% to close at 5,455.21, and marked its fifth straight winning day. The Nasdaq Composite\\nshook off earlier losses to close higher by just 0.03% at 17,192.60. Consumer prices increased 2.9% year-over-year, down from 3% in June and the lowest reading since March 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. Month-over-month, prices ticked up 0.2%. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a 0.2% increase from the prior month and a 3% gain year-over-year. So-called core inflation, which strips out food and energy from the headline number, advanced 0.2% on the month, also in line with expectations. The report comes a day after lighter-than-expected wholesale inflation figures gave stocks a boost. The Dow rose about 1%. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7%, while the Nasdaq gained 2.4%. Investors had been looking toward the CPI reading to get a full-plated picture of the state of the economy, and to further solidify the prospect of an interest rate cut at the central bank’s September meeting. “It may not have been as cool as yesterday’s PPI, but today’s as-expected CPI likely won’t rock the boat,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing for E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. “Now the primary question is whether the Fed will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points next month.” Futures market pricing is roughly split down the middle between expectations for a quarter or half-percentage point reduction at central bank meeting on Sept.17-18, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\\nBy the end of the year, traders expect a basis point shift. “If most of the data over the next five weeks points to a slowing economy, the Fed may cut more aggressively,” Larkin said. Elsewhere, shares of Kellanova\\nsurged more than 7.8% following news that the company would be acquired by snack maker Mars in a $36 billion deal. Shares of Google-parent company Alphabet\\nslipped 2.3% following news that the U.S. Department of Justice was weighing an effort to break up the technology behemoth. All three major averages are now above their Aug. 2 closing level, which was the session before the global market sell-off on Aug. 5 that appeared to be related to an unwind of the yen carry trade and concerns about economic growth. “While growth risks have increased, we believe the market has overreacted to a small number of soft data points, not a drastic change to the macro outlook.” said Gargi Chaudhuri, chief investment and portfolio strategist at BlackRock.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'PUBLISHED WED, APR 9 20255:42 AM EDT',\n",
       "  'content': 'The 10-year Treasury yield retreated from its highs of the day after a successful bond auction eased concerns about demand for U.S. debt. The bond market — not a plunging stock market — has been the talk of Wall Street with prices tumbling and yields spiking, unusual action during times when fears of a recession are growing and fixed income is usually relied on as a safe haven from turmoil elsewhere. But yields were backing off the highs Wednesday afternoon. A 90-day pause in some tariffs announced by President Donald Trump helped to eased some mounting worries in the fixed income market. The 10-year Treasury note yield was last up 5 basis points to 4.31% after climbing overnight above 4.51%. As recently as last week, the 10-year yield, which helps decide rates on mortgages, credit card debt and auto loans, was below 3.9%. The 30-year Treasury bond yield\\nhit a high of 5.02% overnight, a level not seen since November 2023. It was last at 4.715%. The 2-year Treasury yield rose nearly 17 basis points to 3.908%, jumping in afternoon trading. The upward move for short-term yields could be a sign that traders think the tariff pause will make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut rates at its upcoming meetings. One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%. Yields and prices move in opposite directions. The bid-cover ratio for the auction of $39 billion in 10-year Treasurys was 2.67, much higher than the prior 10-year auction, indicating strong demand. So-called indirects accounted for more than 87% of the bids, signaling solid demand from holders such as foreign investors.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Trump tariffs have officially kicked in — and they include a ghastly 104% duty on Chinese imports.  Despite growing consternation and concern expressed by economists and CEOs, Trump administration officials have been stubborn in defending its trade policies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Tuesday that roughly 70 countries want to discuss deals with the White House, while trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday said tariffs are not negotiable. (Whether discussing deals is a form of negotiation is apparently debatable.)  But at least one member of the Trump cadre doesn’t seem too happy about the tariffs. Elon Musk, while not addressing the White House’s trade policies specifically, described Navarro — the administration’s top trade advisor — as a “moron” and “dangerously dumb.” Musk is the de facto DOGE leader, a key role in the Trump administration. He is also the CEO of Tesla, a multinational company. Still, given how staunchly White House officials have been advocating for tariffs, it doesn’t seem likely that Musk’s public feud with Navarro will staunch the wound on global trade.'},\n",

For the skeptics, that is like desperately squinting for a silver lining. It might very well be. But the dark clouds, in the form of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, are more ominous than usual. Tariffs, after all, are a tax on imported goods that will likely be passed on to the consumer. That has weighed on consumer sentiment, as measured by surveys like those from the University of Michigan. Even U.S. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett acknowledged that Trump’s tariffs will cause some uncertainty. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has already lowered its growth outlook for the U.S. because of that.

All major U.S. benchmarks sank, with the Nasdaq Composite limping into correction territory and losing its post-election Trump bump.

Much of that falls upon Nvidia’s new Blackwell artificial intelligence chip, which Big Tech companies are pouring billions into. The chipmaker also downplayed concerns over DeepSeek, saying that more efficient AI models still require plenty of processing power in the long run. Meanwhile, consumer surveys from the Consumer Board and the University of Michigan show intensifying concerns over the economy and inflation. That’s culminated in the 10-year Treasury yield passing below that of the 3-month note, causing an “inverted yield curve” — an accepted, and largely accurate, sign of an impending recession within 18 months. Even as Nvidia is raking in revenue and Big Tech is powering ahead with capex, confidence in the U.S. economy seems to be wobbling slightly. It remains to be seen if tech can stabilize that.'},\n",

A day prior, the Bank of England lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, following the European Central Bank’s cut of the same amount on Jan. 30. Many economies seem to be settling into a lower-rate environment as policymakers look to boost economic growth. That’s in stark contrast with the U.S. — it’s unclear if the U.S. Federal Reserve would even deliver on its two rate cuts in 2025, forecast in December, given the uncertainties over the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies. Moreover, Trump seems to have backed off from applying pressure on the Fed. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. dollar began strengthening and hit its highest level in more than two years, as measured by the U.S. dollar index. That’s already affected companies such as Amazon, which blamed the currency for weighing down its expected revenue in the current quarter.

Trump’s comments on Sunday that he agreed with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged could have also watered down investors’ expectations (however far-fetched) for lower rates.

Apple\\n’s iPhone launch event begins at 1 p.m. ET Monday. Does anyone care about artificial intelligence anymore? Seems fair to ask considering the recent trading in stocks lumped into the AI trade, including key enabler and fellow Club name Nvidia\\n, which is down almost 14% in the past five sessions. 3. Did we just find out why Club holding Disney\\n’s stock has been stuck at $90 a share? The New York Times published a deep dive into the power struggle at Disney that ensued as CEO Bob Iger returned to the top job almost two years ago, replacing his chosen successor Bob Chapek.

       "  'content': '1. Unwinding of the Great Carry Trade of Japan … or not. One factor playing a role in the sell-off Monday was the unwinding of the popular “carry trade” strategy that seeks to profit on interest rate differentials. We took advantage of the volatility to put cash to work in quality U.S. stocks that were being dragged down. On Tuesday, the Nikkei 225, which had its largest decline in the previous session since the 1987 Black Monday crash — rose more than 10%. 2. Uber\\nreported much better-than-expected results for the second quarter: EPS of 47 cents vs. consensus estimate of 31 cents, according to LSEG; $10.7 billion vs. $10.57 billion expected. The stock rose 6% in pre-market trading. 3. Google loses case but wins the war? A federal U.S. judge ruled Monday the company has illegally held a monopoly in search and text advertising, with the court focusing in on the Alphabet\\ncompany’s exclusive arrangements on Android and Apple\\ndevices. Barclays sees both Google and Apple as losers from the ruling. I don’t buy that. Google said it plans to appeal. Both Google and Apple are longtime Club holdings.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'SINGAPORE — Customers in Asia-Pacific have picked their favorite banks as lenders scramble to meet consumer expectations in a fast-changing environment. After a prolonged period of high inflation — and interest rates — banks in the region are starting to navigate the global trend of lower rates. They’re also facing technological innovation that has the potential to transform the sector, as generative AI gains traction around the world. Against this backdrop, market research firm Statista surveyed 22,000 individuals with a checking or savings account in 14 major economies. The report below — the first of its kind — is designed to highlight the banks that best meet consumer needs in their respective markets. For the survey, participants evaluated their overall satisfaction with a bank, and whether they would recommend it to others. They also rated each based on five criteria: trust, terms and conditions (such as fees and rates), customer service, digital services and quality of financial advice. Click here for the full methodology. See below to see which banks made the list in your location.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'After a brief respite, the Magnificent 7 stocks have again hit new highs on the heels of Nvidia’s blowout earnings: They now again comprise about 30% of the S&P 500. Throw in the remainder of the top 10 stocks (Berkshire Hathaway, Lilly, and Broadcom) and the concentration rises to about 33% of the S&P 500. At the recent ETF conference in Miami Beach, Registered investment advisors were eager for advice on how they might get their clients to stop pestering them to invest more money in the Magnificent 7. There was much handwringing about the dangers of over-concentration. RIAs worried that just like they get blamed for not being in the Mag 7 rally with sufficient zest, they will get clobbered by clients blaming them when (and if) they bubble bursts. The hope of the RIAs was the market rally would broaden out. Fat chance. That was two weeks ago, during a brief lull in the relentless march of Nvidia and the Magnificent 7. But Nvidia’s earnings have killed the last hope of the “diversify” crowd. The numbers speak for themselves: Major Sectors YTD Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) up 20% (25% Nvidia!) Roundhill Magnificent 7 ETF (MAGS) up 14% (14% Nvidia!) S&P 500 up 5% (4% Nvidia!) S&P 500 Equal-Weight ETF (RSP) up 2% On the surface, it sure seems that way. The comparisons are getting silly. At the ETF conference, Dimensional Fund Advisors noted that the Magnificent 7 stocks were now just as large as the entire combined stock markets of Japan, UK, Canada, France, Hong Kong/China combined: Magnificent 7 vs. The World (MSCI All Country World Index weighting) Entire U.S. stock market: 63% Japan, UK, Canada, France, Hong Kong/China combined: 17.5% Magnificent 7: 17% Source: Dimensional Funds That seems crazy, no? And yet, it’s not at all unusual to see concentration like this in prior periods. And it’s mostly around tech. It’s true concentration has risen in the last 10 years. As late as 2015, the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 were only 17.8% of the index, according to a 2023 study by FS Investments. But that was a low point. Most of the time, the concentration of the top 10 stocks has been far higher. For example, in the mid-1960s the concentration of the top 10 was over 40% of the S&P 500. The domination of the so-called “Nifty 50” stocks (which included IBM, American Express, General Electric, Polaroid and Xerox) in the 1960s and early 1970s regularly kept the concentration of the top 10 stocks over 30%. It slowly declined over the next 20 years, settling between roughly 17% and 20% of the market capitalization of the S&P 500 between the 1980s and the late 1990s. It shot up again during the dotcom and Internet boom, which again pushed the concentration of the top 10 to over 25% in the late 1990s. Other countries like China, France, and Germany have far higher concentration in the top 10 names than the U.S. The broadest China ETF, the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI\\n) has over 600 stocks. But the top 10 stocks, which include Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu, comprise 42% of the entire ETF. Same with Germany: The iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG\\n) has 57% of its weighting in 10 stocks, with 22% in just two stocks, SAP and Siemens. Same with the United Kingdom: The iShares MSCI UK (EWU\\n) has 50% in the top 10 holdings, with nearly a quarter in three stocks, Shell, AstraZeneca, and HSBC. Same with France: The iShares MSCI France (EWQ\\n) has 57% in the top 10 with just two companies — LVMH and Total — comprising 20% of the weighting. And same with Canada: The iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index (XIU\\n) has 45% in the top 10 holdings. Concentration of top 10 stocks in country indexes China 42% Germany 57% UK: 50% France: 57% Canada 45% U.S.: 33% You may worry about it, but concentration has been a boon to index investors and to U.S. investors in general. We all know the majority of the gains in the last year can be attributed to a small number of mostly tech stocks. Investors who own the S&P 500\\ndon’t have to pick those winners; they just go along for the ride. Second, U.S. stocks are global market leaders, and when a small group becomes market leaders it almost always means the U.S. stock market outperforms the world. That is exactly what has happened. The U.S. stock market, which was roughly 40% of the global market capitalization a short while ago, is now roughly 50% of global market capitalization. U.S. investors in broadly diversified indexes have been richly rewarded for their “concentration risk.” Here’s what it all means: Concentration is a characteristic of market cap-weighted indexes. These indexes reward the winners and penalize the losers. The reason the Magnificent 7 has done so well is that these are the most profitable companies in the world. They are at the cutting edge of transformative technologies, particularly AI. That’s the primary reason they are the leaders. There are also secondary reasons: globalization, which made supply chains more efficient, and the long decline in interest rates (which has come to an end). But the bottom line is that in an era where growth has been hard to come by, these companies have plenty of it. And investors are willing to pay up. What about comparisons to the dot-com era? The stocks at the top contribute a far greater amount to the earnings of the S&P 500 than they did in the 1990s. And the cash flow is much higher. There’s already been a correction: It was called 2022 At the ETF conference, the big worry among the RIAs was, “But what if there’s a big correction in the Magnificent 7?” Uh, sorry, but they already corrected. Nvidia went from roughly $292 at the start of 2022 to $112 by October of that year, a drop of 62%. The other Magnificent 7 stocks all had big drops then. Of course they could all correct again. But the AI revolution is very real. Nvidia’s sales tripled. Profits were up 800%. That is a very real revolution.'},\n",

       "  'content': '1. Novo Nordisk\\nshares sank more than 20% this morning after the maker of Ozempic cut its full-year guidance and named a new CEO. The company cited “persistent use of compounded GLP-1s.” Club name Eli Lilly\\n, which competes with Mounjaro and Zepbound, saw its stock drop 4% following the Novo Nordisk news. Lilly reports earnings Aug. 7. 2. Also in the Club portfolio, Starbucks\\nis set to report earnings after this afternoon’s closing bell. We want to hear about how CEO Brian Niccol’s turnaround efforts are going. We have faith in Niccol’s ability to right the ship based on his overhaul of Chipotle. However, it looks like Starbucks is going to be a much harder turn. 3. UnitedHealth\\nreported a dramatic guide down but forecast a return to growth in 2026. Doesn’t seem like a trusted forecast. The troubled company reported its mixed quarter just days after it said it was cooperating with the Justice Department investigation into its Medicare billing. The Dow stock, already on a slide since April, dropped roughly 1.5% this morning. 4. Merck\\n, also a Dow stock, dropped 4% after the drugmaker announced a goal of $3 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2027. The company is positioning ahead of blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda patent expiration in 2028. Merck also reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, the first miss since April 2021, and narrowed its full-year guidance. 5. Boeing\\nwas a Dow stock winner this morning after cutting quarterly losses and reporting the most deliveries of planes since 2018. Revenue beat expectations. CEO Kelly Ortberg said “change takes time,” but he sees 2025 as “our turnaround year.” The stock rose nearly 1% this morning, adding to its more than 30% year-to-date gains. 6. Procter & Gambl\\ne shares gained nearly 2% after the consumer products giant beat on quarterly earnings and revenue. P&G announced fiscal 2026 guidance that included a $1 billion drag due to higher costs from tariffs. It also cited unfavorable commodity costs, higher net interest expense and core effective tax rates. The company also announced a CEO transition. 7. Union Pacific\\nhas agreed to buy smaller rival Norfolk Southern\\nin a $85 billion deal. If approved, the combined company would be the nation’s first coast-to-coast freight rail operator. There are reports that this deal has prompted competitors BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway\\n, and CSX\\nto explore merger options. 8. Wall Street was on track for a higher open, which would add to yesterday’s 15th record close of the year for the S&P 500\\n. The United States and China resumed trade talks today after the weekend announcement of a trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union. Last week, President Donald Trump unveiled a trade deal with Japan. 9. Club name Nvidia\\n, according to Reuters, has placed orders with its manufacturer, Taiwan Semi\\n, for 300,000 China-specific H20 chips. The report indicated that Nvidia won’t be relying on just its stockpile of these chips, which this month got approval from the Trump administration to sell in China again. 10. Wells Fargo raised its price target on Club name Amazon\\nto $245 a share from $238. OK, this is the kind of fatuous PT boost based totally on conjecture that gets you in trouble because it presumes a great quarter. Amazon reports earnings after Thursday’s close.

       "  'content': 'The 10-year Treasury yield retreated from its highs of the day after a successful bond auction eased concerns about demand for U.S. debt. The bond market — not a plunging stock market — has been the talk of Wall Street with prices tumbling and yields spiking, unusual action during times when fears of a recession are growing and fixed income is usually relied on as a safe haven from turmoil elsewhere. But yields were backing off the highs Wednesday afternoon. A 90-day pause in some tariffs announced by President Donald Trump helped to eased some mounting worries in the fixed income market. The 10-year Treasury note yield was last up 5 basis points to 4.31% after climbing overnight above 4.51%. As recently as last week, the 10-year yield, which helps decide rates on mortgages, credit card debt and auto loans, was below 3.9%. The 30-year Treasury bond yield\\nhit a high of 5.02% overnight, a level not seen since November 2023. It was last at 4.715%. The 2-year Treasury yield rose nearly 17 basis points to 3.908%, jumping in afternoon trading. The upward move for short-term yields could be a sign that traders think the tariff pause will make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut rates at its upcoming meetings. One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%. Yields and prices move in opposite directions. The bid-cover ratio for the auction of $39 billion in 10-year Treasurys was 2.67, much higher than the prior 10-year auction, indicating strong demand. So-called indirects accounted for more than 87% of the bids, signaling solid demand from holders such as foreign investors.'},\n",

Many economies seem to be settling into a lower-rate environment as policymakers look to boost economic growth. That’s in stark contrast with the U.S. — it’s unclear if the U.S. Federal Reserve would even deliver on its two rate cuts in 2025, forecast in December, given the uncertainties over the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies. Moreover, Trump seems to have backed off from applying pressure on the Fed. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. dollar began strengthening and hit its highest level in more than two years, as measured by the U.S. dollar index. That’s already affected companies such as Amazon, which blamed the currency for weighing down its expected revenue in the current quarter.

The country welcomed 2.93 million foreign visitors in August, followed by another 2.87 million visitors in September — well above the 2.52 million and 2.27 million who arrived during those same months in 2019, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. Historically, Japan sees a lull of tourists in August and September, followed by a bump in visitors in October from travelers in search of fall foliage or Tokyo’s storied Halloween celebrations. But this year, that drop is expected to be muted, as the country is experiencing a long-awaited rise in arrivals from Chinese travelers, a trend which began in June. Before the pandemic, China was Japan’s largest tourism source market, representing 30% of all arrivals, according to Japanese authorities.

Google Trends showed that searches related to “leaving the country” and “how to move to …” spiked following the news that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. Searches for “how to move to Canada” peaked on Nov. 6, with Google Trends showing interest in the phrase highest among Democratic strongholds, like Vermont, Maine, Oregon and Washington. Those searching for “can I move to another country” were highest in two pivotal “blue wall” swing states — Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which NBC News has called for Trump — as well as Oregon, Minnesota and Indiana. A survey conducted earlier this month found that 21% of Americans said they would consider moving abroad if their preferred candidate lost the race. However, the sentiment seemed to be founded more on frustration, rather than actual intention, according to the survey conducted by Casino.org, which provides news, information and research to gamers.

       "  'date': 'Aug 12, 2025',\n",
       "  'content': \"Japan’s Nikkei 225 stock index hit an all-time record Tuesday, rising as high as ¥42,999.71 — and closing up 2.15%, at ¥42,718.17 — on trade optimism and hope for an interest rate cut in the United States. The surprise rally, which came after months of uncertainty and with the country on the cusp of recession, took the benchmark beyond its July 2024 record of ¥42,426.77. The index is now up almost 18% over the past year.  Stocks took off after Japan and the United States partially addressed their dispute on how to execute a trade deal reached on July 22, with the U.S. agreeing to revise its executive order so that Japan's “reciprocal” tariff is calculated in a way that results in a lower effective rate. U.S. interest rate expectations may have also played a role in the rally. The easing of the tariff shock has been a driver of stock performance, said Nozomi Moriya, managing director and equity strategist at UBS Securities Japan. “The market has been performing more strongly than expected,” Moriya said. “In the global market as well, although there have been concerns over tariffs, there has also been growing anticipation — particularly in the U.S. — of a shift toward monetary easing. I believe this has also been a driver.” Shares in Toyota Motor, Japan’s largest company by market capitalization, rose 2.95% on Tuesday; Honda was up 2.61%, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial rose 4.41%. SoftBank Group shares ended the day 6.92% higher. The yen was steady, at about ¥148.2 to the dollar. The Nikkei 225 had been weighed down by tariff and rate concerns since hitting the last record. In April, it fell as low as ¥30,792.74 after reciprocal tariffs instituted by U.S. President Donald Trump came into effect. Stocks rallied as Trump retreated on implementation and as trade talks between the United States and Japan progressed, with a deal reached on July 22. Last week, Japan said that the United States agreed to change some language in the U.S. executive order on the reciprocal tariffs so that the calculation method for Japan would be in line with the method used for the European Union. In the original executive order, the reciprocal tariff was added to existing tariffs. Under the revised method, the reciprocal tariff — 15% — would operate as a cap of sorts, so tariffs lower than 15% would be taken to 15% and tariffs higher than 15% would not be increased. Recent developments in U.S.-China trade talks might also have contributed to market optimism. On Monday in Washington and Tuesday morning in Beijing, the White House and China’s Commerce Ministry issued a statement to extend the suspension of higher-rate tariffs on each other for another 90 days to allow for further negotiations. Japan's Topix, an index with far more constituents than the Nikkei 225, hit a new record on Friday. Moriya said that while the strong stock prices reflect a degree of optimism now, how the tariffs affect corporate earnings and the overall economy still needs to be monitored. “While I think the uncertainty over the tariff policy itself has come down to some extent, the effects of the tariffs themselves are something that should still be viewed cautiously,” she said. The Nikkei 225 hit 38,957.44 on Dec. 29, 1989, and traded below that level for the next three decades. At one point during that time, it was down by more than 80% from its then-record high. It finally rose to a new high on Feb. 22, 2024.\"}]"

       "  'date': 'Aug 5, 2025',\n",
       "  'content': 'The combined group net profits of Japan\\'s five major banking groups in April-June increased 2.7% from a year earlier to ¥1.375 trillion ($9.34 billion), due partly to growth in income from their lending operations reflecting interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan, according to their earnings reports released by Monday. Net profit grew 1.5% to ¥376.8 billion at Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, 0.4% to ¥290.5 billion at Mizuho Financial Group and 36.2% to ¥90.8 billion at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group. The three groups\\' April-June profits are the highest since they were established.  Resona Holdings\\' net profit grew 27.3% to ¥70.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group saw its net profit decline 1.8% to ¥546 billion, due to a change in the accounting period at Bank of Ayudhya, a Thai subsidiary. For the full year to March 2026, Mizuho expects its group net profit will total ¥1.02 trillion, up from a previously forecast ¥940 billion and topping the ¥1 trillion threshold for the first time. Concerns about the impact of the high tariff measures of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, such as fundraising issues and the postponements of investment, have been limited at client companies, a Mitsubishi UFJ official indicated. The three megabank groups — Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial and Mizuho — have estimated that the Trump tariffs could help reduce their fiscal 2025 profits by around ¥80 billion to ¥110 billion. But a Sumitomo Mitsui Financial official said, \"The impact could possibly be smaller than forecast.\"'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Factory output gain in Japan shows firms’ resilience amid tariffs',\n",
       "  'date': 'Jul 31, 2025',\n",
       "  'content': 'Factory output in Japan unexpectedly rose in June as manufacturers showed resilience even as U.S. tariffs weigh on the nation’s exports. Industrial production gained 1.7% from the previous month, the industry ministry reported Thursday. Output of transport equipment excluding cars, up 14.8%, and electronic parts and devices drove the gains. Economists had expected a 0.8% loss. Output increased 4% from a year earlier, topping expectations of a 1.3% gain.  The output of autos, which faced tariffs totaling 27.5% on shipments to the U.S. during the period, nudged 0.1% higher from the prior month. Output for steel and non-ferrous metals declined by 0.5% after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled the duty on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum to 50% in early June. \"I think production increased in some areas to respond to rush demand in anticipation of the tariff hike,” said Yuichi Kodama, economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. \"The trend is difficult to grasp due to such demand, but I think production largely remained flat on a quarterly basis.” Seasonally adjusted production advanced by 0.3% in the quarter through June from the previous period, reducing the risk that the economy may have fallen into a technical recession in the period. The gains are forecast to continue after the U.S. and Japan reached a trade agreement with terms considered more favorable to Japan than had been feared. Last week’s surprise deal will cut tariffs on U.S. imports of Japanese cars to 15% and apply the same rate on other products. Inventories fell 0.4% in June, the third straight month of month-on-month declines, bringing the index down to 99.1, the lowest in just over three years. That indicates that manufacturers have room to add product in months ahead. Manufacturers estimated monthly production will rise 1.8% in July and gain 0.8% in August, according to Thursday’s release. Separately, retail sales exceeded estimates, rising 1% in June from May and increasing 2% from a year ago. Persistent inflation has kept consumer spending from posting sustained gains as households contending with higher costs for essential goods trimmed discretionary outlays. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, under pressure to do more to help households cope with inflation, has pledged cash handouts to spur consumption and undertaken steps to reduce utility costs. Ishiba’s position was weakened substantially by his party’s historic upper house election defeat earlier this month. He’s said he’d like to remain in office to ensure the implementation of the trade deal. The production data come hours before the Bank of Japan’s board concludes its latest policy meeting, where authorities are widely expected to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged. A focus will be Gov. Kazuo Ueda’s assessment of the recent trade deal with the U.S. Officials see the possibility of mulling another interest rate hike this year after that agreement, people familiar with the matter said last week. \"It will take more time for the impact of tariffs to be confirmed in hard data, so the BOJ is unlikely to raise interest rates today,” Kodama said.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Meiji Yasuda Life to shun superlong Japanese debt for year or more',\n",
       "  'date': 'Jul 8, 2025',\n",
       "  'content': 'Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance plans to avoid actively investing in Japanese superlong-term government bonds for the next one to two years as interest rates may rise and supply pressures build. Fiscal expansion concerns propelled Japanese government bond yields on Monday ahead of the Upper House election later this month, adding further momentum to a rise stoked by a view that inflation is quicker than the central bank’s expectations.  \"The Bank of Japan will continue to raise interest rates,” Kenichiro Kitamura, Meiji Yasuda\\'s operating officer and general manager of investment planning and research department, said in an interview last week, while predicting that 30-year bond yields, currently at just below 3%, could rise to 3.2% to 3.3% by fiscal 2026. \"When the peak becomes apparent, it will be a good time to buy, but now is not the right time,” he added. Instead, the company is considering hedged foreign bonds as an alternative investment. U.S. interest rates are at high levels and there is room for yields to decline as the Federal Reserve may cut rates, and \"considering the risk of yen appreciation due to the narrowing U.S.-Japan interest rate differential, hedged foreign bonds are a viable option,” Kitamura said. Japanese life insurance companies, which were expected to fill the void left by a retreating BOJ as buyers of the country’s long-term debt, are holding off on significant purchases as further interest rate hikes loom. Life insurance companies’ appetite for superlong-term bonds has been declining and purchases have slowed significantly over the past few years after their buying streak to meet new solvency rules. Meiji Yasuda may gradually see its appetite for duration make a comeback as it seeks to match its long-dated liabilities on account of new product launches. In April, the insurer launched a new group pension product with an increased scheduled interest rate. It also raised the scheduled interest rate for individual savings insurance products and is focusing on acquiring new insurance contracts. \"As insurance liabilities increase, we will invest in ultra-long-term bonds,” said Kitamura.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Komeito to propose sales tax cut on food, Yomiuri reports',\n",
       "  'date': 'Jun 4, 2025',\n",
       "  'content': \"Japan's junior ruling coalition partner, Komeito, will propose cutting the consumption tax rate for food items from 8% to 5% in a campaign pledge for the Upper House election slated in July, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported on Wednesday. The campaign pledge, to be announced on Friday, will also include a proposal to offer cash payouts to cushion the blow to households from rising living costs, the paper said.  A Komeito official confirmed the report, saying the tax cut idea will be among proposals in the campaign pledge due on Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly. The proposed stimulus plan will be funded by an expected increase in tax revenues instead of additional debt issuance, according to the draft obtained by the Yomiuri. Japan applies an 8% consumption tax rate for food and 10% for other items, with the proceeds mostly used to fund social welfare costs for a rapidly aging economy. A proposal to cut the tax rate from Komeito, which is a junior coalition partner of the Liberal Democratic Party, would add pressure on Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to offer more fiscal support to voters ahead of the Upper House poll. Ishiba and senior LDP officials so far have pushed back against calls from opposition parties to cut the consumption tax rate, arguing that doing so would worsen Japan's already tattered finances. Concern over Japan's huge public debt, which will become more expensive to finance as the Bank of Japan eyes further interest rate hikes, has been among factors that led to a surge in super-long government bond yields last month.\"},\n",
       " {'title': \"Government capital is not just 'silly money'\",\n",
       "  'date': 'May 18, 2025',\n",
       "  'content': \"Silicon Valley-minded venture capitalists (VCs) around the world tend to blindly criticize government capital for innovation as “silly money.” For sure, there has been a global trend to replicate concepts from Silicon Valley with regards to the “power law” of venture capital, “move fast, break things” disruption, avoidance of government and the “fake it until you make it” confidence, among others.  Nothing could be more wrong — especially when Silicon Valley is fundamentally a sui generis culture and ecosystem. Unlike Silicon Valley's predominantly private-sector-driven ecosystem, many Asian societies exhibit greater risk aversion, necessitating proactive government involvement to stimulate entrepreneurial activity. Historically, government funding and industrial policy have played a pivotal role in fostering innovation and supporting startups across Asia, starting with Japan, followed by other countries like South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, among others. And we must not forget that, even in the establishment of the Silicon Valley ecosystem, the U.S. government and military played a big role in the postwar years and the military even laid the foundation for the invention of the internet and the semiconductor chip. In particular, the commercialization of cutting-edge fundamental research at universities carries high risks and very long gestation periods that could be unpalatable to private-sector players. Further, deep-tech and life-science research from universities are often of strategic interest to governments, particularly from the angles of national security and economic development, which typical investors may not be attracted to. Indeed, government-backed VCs, including public university VCs are more inclined to invest in early-stage companies, particularly those emerging from academic or research institutions. On the other hand, independent VCs tend to focus on later-stage investments where the risk is lower and the potential for returns is clearer. This approach often leads to underinvestment in nascent technologies and startups that require more time and support to mature. A study by Iqbal Muhammad and Stephanie Serve analyzing 3,817 firms across nine Asian developing countries from 1991 to 2017 found that government-backed startups were more likely to receive early-stage financing compared to those backed by independent VC firms. And while government-backed VCs may have a lower likelihood of successful exits compared with independent VCs, which tend to follow more rigorous due diligence processes and market-driven strategies, government-backed startups perform better in the expansion and later stages thanks to early investments aimed at unlocking exponential innovation. As examples across Asia, Singapore's government actively supports startups through initiatives like the Startup SG Equity program. Last year, an additional $338 million was allocated to this program, increasing the investment cap per startup from $6 million to $9 million. Taiwan's government has invested approximately $211.6 million over five years to support local equipment and materials suppliers in building research and development capabilities. Meanwhile, mainland China exemplifies a robust government-led approach to innovation. In 2022, tax rebates for corporate R&D reached 1.3 trillion Chinese yuan (approximately $180 billion), marking a 28.8% annual growth rate since 2018. Additionally, in 2025, China launched a 1 trillion yuan ($138 billion) government-backed venture fund targeting emerging technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence. With this context, a key platform to commercialize fundamental research — especially from universities and research institutions — are government-backed university VCs and incubation programs. In the early stage deep-tech space, incubators turn basic research into commercializable ideas and found companies, while university VCs would invest when startups at the seed stage are ready to create products based on their intellectual property and beyond. In 2022, the Japanese government launched the University Fund of Japan, a ¥10 trillion ($68.5 billion) endowment aimed at revitalizing the nation's research capabilities and fostering innovation. This initiative addresses concerns over declining research performance and aims to position Japanese universities as global leaders in scientific research. Profits from the investments are distributed to selected universities, with a maximum annual allocation of ¥300 billion ($2 billion). The duration is suitably long for early stage deep-tech investments — the support is structured to continue for up to 25 years, providing long-term financial stability to recipient institutions. Universities are chosen based on their strategies for research excellence and organizational reform. Tohoku University was the first institution selected under this program. Public university VCs like Kyoto-iCAP (Kyoto University Innovation Capital), where the author works, are also designed to take high risks to commercialize fundamental university research through government funding alongside private-sector limited partners. Its funds, with a capital size of more than $220 million, have a duration of 12 to 15 years to reflect the high risks and long gestation periods. Indeed, according to Global University Venturing, Japan has one of the most advanced university VC ecosystems in Asia — 85% of its top universities have an investment vehicle to support its startups. Other notable Japanese university VCs are University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners (UTEC) — which leads the pack with an approximate capital size of $594 million, University of Tokyo Innovation Platform, Osaka University Venture Capital and Tohoku University Venture Partners. More than 40% of European institutions and more than half of Australian campuses have funds too. In contrast, only about a third of U.S. universities maintain such investment vehicles, which goes back to the U.S. and Silicon Valley having a unique private-sector-dominated ecosystem that is backed by a highly entrepreneurial and risk-taking culture. Some of the successful exits that have emerged from the university VC ecosystem are Kyoto iCAP-funded Cuorips and Chordia Therapeutics, UTEC-funded PeptiDream and Spiber, National University of Singapore-incubated and Temasek-backed VC fund Vertex-funded PatSnap and Oxford Science Enterprises-backed Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Immunocore. Going forward, especially when deep-tech fields like semiconductors, materials, clean energy, AI and life sciences become more strategically important for Asian societies, further funding from governments and universities are crucial. This can eventually scale the early stage of a deep-tech startup ecosystem and encourage risk-sharing that could attract more private-sector players.  \"},\n",

       " {'title': 'Odds of early rate rise increase as inflation becomes the fight in Japan',\n",
       "  'date': 'Feb 28, 2025',\n",
       "  'content': 'Sticky inflation might convince the Bank of Japan to lean hawkish and increase rates earlier than expected. “An important factor is food inflation,” said Daiju Aoki, regional chief investment officer at UBS SuMi Trust Wealth Management in Tokyo.  “Of the overall 4% price increase in January, food products alone were responsible for more than half of the upward pressure.” In January, the central bank raised its short-term policy rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. No policy board meeting was held in February, and the next is scheduled for March 18 to 19. Until recently, Aoki was thinking that the central bank would not raise rates until October. \"I believed that a major condition was the sustainable and solid growth of real wages, which would lead to a clear expansion of consumption and domestic demand,” Aoki said. The BOJ is closely watching this year\\'s spring offensive wage negotiations, in particular how smaller companies do at the bargaining table. Since the central bank would have to wait at least several months to assess the data, Aoki expected the next increase would be in the fall. But now, he thinks it’s possible that the BOJ will make a move as early as May, as bank officials have sent more hawkish signals over the past month or so. On Feb. 19, Hajime Takata, a member of the BOJ policy board, said that underlying inflation is trending around the bank’s 2% target. “I believe it will be important for the bank to consider continuing to implement gear shifts gradually, even after the additional rate hike decided in January,” he noted. BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda indicated that the central bank is paying more attention to higher food prices. The governor told parliament on Feb. 12 that the central bank is aware that food price increases are negatively affecting households. “The BOJ may be starting to think that the negative impact of leaving the inflation rate unchecked outweighs the negative impact of rate hikes,” Aoki said. Government data released last week showed Japan’s inflation was higher than expected in January due to higher food prices. Overall inflation was 4%, the highest in two years, compared with 3.6% in December. Fresh food prices rose at the fastest pace in two decades, and the price of rice was up 70.9% on the year. According to separate data released by the internal affairs ministry on Friday, the overall inflation rate in Tokyo was 2.9% in February, down from 3.4% in January. But food price inflation was 7.1%. The BOJ has stressed that inflation pressure mainly driven by cost-push factors, such as the yen’s weakening, will likely start to ease in the second half of this year. After the BOJ increased interest rates in January, a number of analysts predicted that the next rate increase would be during the summer. Recent market trends indicate that investors are bracing for an early interest rate hike by the BOJ. The Japanese currency is now trading below the ¥150-to-the-dollar level from about ¥155 at the beginning of the month, while the benchmark yield of 10-year Japanese government bonds hit a 15-year high last week. Tokyo stocks have been under pressure. The 225-issue Nikkei stock average has been stuck around the 38,000-to-39,000 level for months, and was down about 3% on Friday. Aoki added that it’s possible that the BOJ is concerned about the implementation of new tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump. Countries with weak currencies such as the yen might be targeted. “The BOJ and the Finance Ministry might be thinking that it is necessary to increase interest rates to the neutral-rate level to show that they are not neglecting yen’s weakness,” he said. The neutral rate is a level of interest rate that neither stimulates nor slows economic growth. It is believed that Japan’s neutral rate is between 1% and 2.5%. Recent economic data support the case for hawkishness. Japan’s gross domestic product in the October-December period of last year grew by an annualized 2.8%, far more than the 1% forecast by a Reuters poll. It was the third consecutive quarter in positive territory. In the July-September period, the GDP increased at an annualized rate of 1.7%, and that followed a 3% increase in the second quarter. Exports received credit for the strong showing in the fourth quarter, although economists also noted that weak domestic demand was a drag on performance.'},\n",

The measure of input prices for Japanese firms rose 4.2% in January from a year earlier, the BOJ reported Thursday. The gain, led by agricultural products such as rice, was bigger than the consensus estimate of 4% and compared with a revised 3.9% advance a month earlier.  The data is likely to support growing market views that the BOJ’s current policy cycle could feature hikes that are faster and culminate in a higher terminal rate than many previously expected. The shift in thinking has helped spur repricing in the bond market. Japan’s 10-year bond yields continued to rise Thursday, hitting the highest level in almost 15 years. The BOJ raised its benchmark rate to the highest level in 17 years last month as inflation and the economy continued to perform in line with the expectations of authorities. In a Bloomberg survey conducted after the January policy gathering, more than half of BOJ watchers said they expect the next hike to come in July. In their risk scenarios, 45% said the action could be taken as early as the board meeting that concludes on May 1. BOJ Gov.

       "  'content': \"  All is quiet at 10:30 a.m. on a Thursday in Shibuya, Tokyo’s famous commercial district. In an alleyway just steps from one of the busiest train stations in the world, a short line of tourists huddles outside of a bar. Finally, half an hour later, the door cracks open and, greeted with a soft “irasshaimase,” or “welcome,” the parties shuffle in to sample one of the rarest dishes in Japan: faux-fish sushi.  “Nowadays, there are many vegan ‘meat’ products,” said Kazue Maeda, one of the four founding employees of the restaurant, Vegan Sushi Tokyo. “But I’m Japanese. What I really used to love is sushi and salmon.” Her restaurant attempts to fill a relatively unclaimed niche in the local food scene. Even in Tokyo, where much of the country’s vegan population lives, plant-based versions of traditional Japanese food remain challenging to find — most vegan options are Western-inspired dishes like curry rice or vegan hamburg steak. Vegan Sushi Tokyo is open only for lunch: Although rave reviews keep pouring in from customers, the small business still doesn’t have a storefront of its own and rents out the interior of a bar by day. It serves 10-piece nigiri lunch sets, which include a plant-based Japanese-style “egg,” “shrimp” tempura and beads made out of seaweed that look nearly indistinguishable from salmon roe. Japan’s culinary culture may be rich and diverse, but it remains reliant on animal products, especially when dashi, a savory broth made of dried tuna flakes and kelp, is present in so many dishes. Maeda became a vegan six years ago, due to her growing concern over environmental and animal rights issues. It’s a familiar origin story for those who have come to defy the typical Japanese diet by giving up meat, fish and dairy. “In terms of the vegan movement, I think we’re maybe behind other countries. The number of vegans is very small,” Maeda said. “But there are more and more vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Tokyo, I think because of tourists — especially from countries with many vegetarian people.”   Outside large cities like Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, vegan options quickly vanish. In a culture that prizes convention and scrupulous attention to detail, individual accommodations — like vegan menu substitutions — are often frowned upon. And as in many other countries, vegan options are sometimes stigmatized as less nutritious. But recently, things have been changing. The anticipation of a tourism boom for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo pushed the Japanese government to encourage new vegan businesses and menu options in major cities. And in the years since, restaurants like Maeda’s have sprung up, offering novel adaptations of traditional dishes. Under pressure from Japan’s pledge to nearly halve its carbon emissions by 2030, the government has also begun collaborating with vegan activists and advocates and awarding grants to alternative protein startups. Though challenges remain, it’s gotten easier and easier to go vegan in Japan over the last decade. “Climate issues and animal issues are growing,” Maeda said. “For me, I can’t imagine going back to eating meat again.” Convincing people to eat less meat is key to reaching international climate goals. Up to 20% of planet-warming greenhouse gases emitted annually come from animal agriculture alone — all the cows, pigs, lambs, chickens and other animals (not including fish) that people raise for meat, milk, eggs and the like. According to one study from the University of Oxford that looked at the diets of over 55,000 people, vegans — defined as those who eschew all animal products — create 75% less climate pollution through their food choices than those who eat a meat-heavy diet. For most of the last two millennia, the Japanese diet was a model of climate-friendly eating due to Buddhist and Shinto objections to meat and dairy consumption — although fish has long been a staple. Beginning in 675, meat-eating was banned by official imperial decree.   The ban set the stage for the flourishing of shōjin ryōri, a traditional cuisine that arrived in the sixth century along with Buddhism and aligns with the religion’s prohibition against killing animals. In the 13th century, the cuisine developed into a spiritual movement focused on simplicity and balance between one’s mind and body. A typical shōjin ryōri set meal is vegan, highlights seasonal produce and is designed around sets of five — five colors, five flavors and five cooking methods. While it can still commonly be found in the dining halls of Buddhist temples, modern chefs have taken shōjin ryōri into the mainstream, including in Michelin-starred restaurants, where they emphasize the concept’s focus on harmony with nature by using local ingredients and minimizing waste. It wasn’t until 1872 that Emperor Meiji lifted the meat-eating ban, seeking to usher in an era of westernization. Meat consumption grew quickly as domestic beef production boomed and animal products became a symbol of power and status. As reports spread that Emperor Meiji drank milk twice a day, dairy consumption became more popular, too. Today, Japan ranks 11th in beef consumption globally, and its per capita milk consumption is 68% higher than that of the average East Asian country. Japanese people buy eight times more meat than they did in the 1960s, and in 2007, families began eating it more than fish. But interest in plant-based foods appears to be growing. Japan’s market for plant-based foods tripled between 2015 and 2020, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries expects it to double again by 2030. These shifts have taken place as the Japanese population at large has expressed a readiness to shift toward plant-based products for health, animal welfare and climate-related reasons, according to a 2022 analysis in the Journal of Agricultural Management. Although no official government statistic exists, a 2021 survey found that 2.2% of Japanese people identify as vegan — a potentially higher percentage than in the United States, where estimates range from 1% to 4%.   Though vegan restaurants have been on the upswing since 2017, Japanese vegans still lack a wide variety of options. According to HappyCow, a popular directory of vegan and vegetarian restaurant options, Japan has fewer than six vegetarian restaurants per 1 million people in Japan, more than a fifth of them in Tokyo. By comparison, there are nine vegetarian restaurants per 1 million people in the U.S. “Even many chefs still don’t know what vegan is, they don’t know the concept,” said Azumi Yamanaka, a vegan activist in Tokyo, during a recent lunch at Brown Rice, a sleek vegan restaurant with an organic, health-focused menu in the capital’s Omotesando district. “They don't realize that adding a small piece of bacon or fish is still meat. I still have to explain it,” she said, while picking at a slice of roasted lotus root with her chopsticks. When Yamanaka became vegan 16 years ago, most people in Japan hadn’t even heard of the term “vegan,” she said. But in recent years, she said, being vegan has become a somewhat fashionable subculture — judging from social media trends and an upswing in photogenic vegan cafes, which she said get more young people interested in becoming vegan, too. Even if trendiness is an effective way to draw people toward plant-based lifestyles, Yamanaka said Japanese who commit to veganism are motivated by a variety of issues, including sustainability and animal rights. The country imports between 40% and 60% of its meat but depends on domestic factory farming to produce much of its dairy supply. Its animal protection laws have been given low grades by international animal welfare organizations. Other factors include the country’s relatively high rate of lactose intolerance, which some estimate affects the majority of the population. Food allergies are also a factor for many of the country’s vegan converts. Between 2010 and 2019, the prevalence of allergies to eggs and milk, along with peanuts and wheat, nearly doubled among Japanese children. And eggs are the country's most common food allergy. Still, Yamanaka said city governments and companies don’t care about expanding vegan options until they want to market to tourists. “They believe vegan products won’t sell, aren’t understood or have failed in the past,” she said. “Many consider them only for foreign visitors.”   Tourism is certainly a huge economic factor in Japan. In 2024, 37 million foreign tourists entered the country, outstripping the previous full-year record by almost 5 million. Over a quarter of these tourists hail from neighboring parts of Asia with large vegan and vegetarian populations, like Taiwan, China and Singapore, due to the widespread practice of Buddhism. “Before 2019, the vegan environment was not so good,” said Mayumi Muroya, chair of the Japan Vegan Society, the largest vegan and plant-based industry organization in Japan. “The reality is that many of the foreigners visiting Japan are vegans and vegetarians. And with the Olympics coming up in 2020, the government knew the number of visitors was going to increase hugely.” In the run-up to the Games, which ultimately took place a year late because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government created food guidelines to help restaurants offer more vegan options and distributed subsidies to help them pay for those options. In 2023, the government permitted two organizations to officially certify vegan products under the Japanese Agricultural Standards, including Muroya’s. Adoption requires in-person inspections, and fewer than 10 businesses have been certified. A different nonprofit, VegeProject Japan, started unofficially certifying products as vegan in 2016, and its marker has become the most widely used vegan label in Japan — showing up on instant curry pouches, protein bars and some cosmetics. Recently, in an effort to make dining easier for tourists, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government began offering subsidies to vegan businesses with foreign language menus available that want to be certified with one of these labels — the Japan Vegan Society’s certification costs an estimated ¥165,000 ($1,060). The beloved and beleaguered tourism hub of Kyoto has also begun investing money into making the city’s vegan options more visible — both to accommodate foreign visitors and due to the city’s pledge to meet the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Japan has used SDGs as the basis for a public awareness campaign on climate change, conservation and sustainability. Despite its small size compared with Tokyo and neighboring Osaka, Kyoto has long been considered an easier place to be vegan than the rest of the country. As both the former capital and a youthful university town, the city is awash with historic businesses maintaining the traditions of a preindustrial Japan and a distinctly crunchy-granola youth culture. Although the population is a sixth of the size of Tokyo’s, it has half as many vegan options. And recently, the local government partnered with Kyoto Vegan, an environmental organization that was founded in 2020 to expand and increase awareness of vegan options in the city. “After 2020, the city asked if they could collaborate with me,” said Chisayo Tamaki, who founded the group.   Kyoto Vegan receives most of its funding from a subsidy from the country’s national tourism agency, but it is also supported by the city as one of its “Do You Kyoto 2050” projects. The initiative aims to cut carbon emissions down to zero by 2050. “They can’t achieve that goal without the support of vegan lifestyles,” said Tamaki. In its plan to reduce its carbon footprint, Kyoto considers veganism to be the 11th most effective way to cut down its emissions, below expanding electric vehicle usage and above teleworking. The private sector is helping to advance those goals. For instance, Plant Based Lifestyle Lab — an initiative backed by a group of companies — began in 2021 to promote and research plant-based food technologies. For Tamaki, it’s a welcome change from just a few years ago when she was told vegans were “demanding” or “picky.” In many ways, people in Japan face the same barriers to veganism as anywhere else. There are the logistical limitations — the lack of options on restaurant menus and at grocery stores. But there are also the psychological ones, like the stigma of being considered picky, exclusion from social activities and misinformation about health and nutrition. In 2021, Muroya — the chair of the Japan Vegan Society — tried introducing monthly vegan lunches at an elementary school near Tokyo, the first attempt of its kind in Japan. Despite working with the school’s nutritionist to design the menu, Muroya’s effort ran into barriers like the national school-lunch calcium requirements, which promote milk, and pushback from parents worried their children wouldn’t get adequate nourishment. (Research shows that well-balanced vegan diets are healthy for most people, as long as they take supplements to provide some vitamins and minerals.) Muroya’s program lasted for only a year, but she said the school still regularly does “meat-free Mondays.”   Perhaps one of the biggest challenges to being vegan in Japan is the country’s culture of conformity — which considers standing out to be troublesome. “Having a different opinion from everybody else is very controversial. Everybody wants to move together as a community,” Yamanaka said. “Some people fear coming out as vegan at school or work due to potential bullying.” Although she said she hasn’t faced much adversity in recent years, former coworkers pressured her to eat meat. For Yamanaka, the best way to make a more sustainable, less meat-intensive Japan is to bridge the gap between vegans and nonvegans. She said that when people discuss various issues that can motivate veganism — like sustainability, factory farming and allergies — as well as the popularity of veganism among tourists, more local governments and businesses can be convinced to make more options available. Local plant-based businesses are already making an effort to appeal to as many customers as possible. At Universal Bakes, a cult-favorite plant-based bakery in Tokyo’s trendy Shimokitazawa neighborhood known for its vegan croissants and savory tarts, the ethos is to provide allergen-free food, not necessarily animal-free. “I want people to understand that vegan food isn’t just for a select few. It’s an inclusive eating style,” Yamanaka said. “Reaching beyond the vegan community is essential for creating a vegan-friendly world.”    \"},\n",

But core inflation fell close to 1% in August, raising concerns that the country may not achieve the BOJ\\'s target of 2% inflation. At a policy meeting on Oct. 7, then-BOJ Deputy Gov. Hiroshi Nakaso expressed a sense of crisis, saying that the central bank\\'s quantitative and qualitative easing policy was at a crucial point. At a meeting on Oct. 31, BOJ policymakers discussed accelerating the pace of annual increase in the monetary base to ¥80 trillion from ¥60 trillion to ¥70 trillion. Nakaso said that the BOJ needs to take a big additional easing step as possible. Kikuo Iwata, another BOJ deputy governor at the time, said that confidence in the central bank\\'s monetary policy would be greatly hurt if it fails to respond appropriately to the risk of a delay in achieving the inflation target. On the other hand, Takahide Kiuchi, a then member of the BOJ\\'s Policy Board, said that additional easing measures would unnecessarily increase the risk of side effects. Yoshihisa Morimoto, another board member at the time, voiced wariness over the possibility of market functions being significantly hindered and more people believing that additional measures were designed to finance fiscal deficits. At the end, the board voted 5-4 to conduct money market operations to increase the monetary base at an annual pace of about ¥80 trillion. Kuroda said it was necessary to avert the risk of a delay in a shift away from a deflationary mindset. The decision took market players by surprise, sending the yen lower against the dollar and Japanese stocks higher. But it failed to lift prices significantly, prompting the BOJ to pursue unconventional measures, including the negative interest rate policy.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The Bank of Japan is on course to raise rates past the 0.5% barrier, unbroken for almost 30 years, if policymakers become confident that the country will achieve 2% inflation stably and sustainably. The central bank\\'s board voted Friday to increase its target for its short-term policy rate to around 0.5% from around 0.25%.  If the BOJ continues to raise the rate, it will become close to the so-called neutral rate of interest, which neither stimulates nor cools the economy. The BOJ expects to raise the policy rate to the neutral rate, believed to be between 1% and 2.5%, by the end of fiscal 2026. A senior BOJ official has said that the central bank should raise the policy rate to at least 1%. However, determining the actual neutral rate is difficult. BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda has said that the question of when to stop raising rates remains a major challenge. The BOJ\\'s policy rate last reached 0.5% roughly 18 years ago, arriving at the level after the central bank raised it by 0.25 percentage point each in July 2006 and February 2007, following its lifting of quantitative monetary easing in March 2006. However, the BOJ resumed quantitative easing following the global financial crisis of 2008, bringing interest rates below zero. There is scarce empirical data on how the Japanese economy would react to sustained interest rate increases, so the BOJ needs to make any decision while closely monitoring economic and price reactions. Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, estimated that Japan\\'s neutral rate of interest is just shy of 1%, given the country\\'s low potential growth rate. The BOJ \"will have to steer policy carefully, so that there are no negative effects on the economy and prices,\" Kiuchi said, predicting that the bank will increase the policy rate to 0.75% in the second half of 2025 before ending rate increases.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Prices for new condominiums in Tokyo fell in 2024, moderating to a more sustainable growth trend after a big jump a year earlier. The average price of a new apartment for sale in the Japanese capital and surrounding areas slipped 3.5% to ¥78 million ($498,000), according to the Real Estate Economic Institute. It was the first decrease in six years, and came after prices rose nearly 30% to a record high in 2023 when several luxury condos went up for sale.  The dip is unlikely to affect the overall trajectory of rising prices for new homes in Tokyo, which is being driven by factors including low supply and higher raw material and labor costs, analysts said. \"We should not see the temporary decrease as a peak,” said Tetsuya Kaneko, head of research at real estate company Savills Japan. \"The general upward trend is here to stay, especially considering the overall inflationary trend and labor shortage.” The number of new units for sale in the Tokyo metropolitan area fell 14.4% last year to a record low, according to the report released Thursday. Average prices for new condos in central Tokyo dropped 2.6% to ¥112 million. The Bank of Japan is widely expected to raise interest rates on Friday, but its impact on the real estate market is likely to be mild as a crowded banking industry keeps a lid on mortgage costs. \"An interest-rate increase would be seen as negative, but its magnitude is offset by the competition among banks,” said Mari Kumagai, head of Japan research at real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.'},\n",

Private-sector members of the council called on the government to create an environment for wage hikes and support corporate investment for growth. The private-sector panel members also urged the government to continue its efforts of bringing the combined primary budget balance of the central and local governments to a surplus, in light of the revival of \"a world with interest rates\" following the Bank of Japan\\'s policy rate hikes.

       "  'date': 'Dec 25, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'Bank of Japan Gov. Kazuo Ueda avoided giving any clear signal that he might raise interest rates next month by sticking to his view that the bank needs to keep monitoring risks for the economy in comments that nudged the yen down a tad. \"The timing and pace of adjusting the degree of monetary accommodation will depend on developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions going forward,” Ueda said in a speech at a business conference in Tokyo on Wednesday.  \"The bank needs to pay due attention to various risk factors at home and abroad, and to examine how these factors will affect the outlook and risks for Japan’s economic activity and prices and the likelihood of realizing the outlook,” he said. The speech comes after Ueda indicated last week that the BOJ may wait longer before raising rates, a view that surprised investors expecting a January move if the bank didn’t act at its December meeting. The unexpected dovishness then triggered a slide in the yen and warnings from the Finance Ministry about one-sided and speculative currency movements. Ueda on Wednesday continued in that vein. He appeared to want to keep his options open by noting the need to keep rates low to support the economy while at the same time flagging the risk of maintaining rates at low levels for too long. \"Gov. Ueda is keeping his hands free as there are lots of uncertainties including the yen and (Donald) Trump,” said Masato Koike, senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus. \"Today’s speech keeps open the chance of a January rate hike but the likelihood of a March move is probably higher. It’s just too early to commit to a hike or no hike in January.” The yen weakened to as much as ¥157.37 against the dollar following his comments in Tokyo from around ¥157.13 at the start of his speech. The move suggested a further recalibration toward a later rate hike among market participants. Still, the speed of the move suggested little immediate chance of the yen breaking the five-month low of ¥157.93 touched last week, or the kind of movement that might trigger further currency intervention by the Japanese government. As Japan transitions toward achieving stable 2% inflation, the BOJ will maintain easy financial conditions by keeping the rate lower than the neutral level to firmly support the economy, Ueda said. \"We have to make sure that Japan’s economy will not return to a deflationary or low-inflation environment,” he said. The BOJ left its benchmark interest rate at 0.25% at its December policy meeting. In Wednesday’s speech, Ueda said he has a lot to monitor by indicating he wants to see more data to gauge momentum in annual spring wage talks and the outlook for the U.S. economy. \"With regard to Japan’s economy, a key issue in the short run is how the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations will develop,” Ueda said. The BOJ hiked interest rates in March for the first time in 17 years just a matter of days after the release of an initial tally of results of this year’s annual pay negotiations between the nation’s biggest union federation and employers. Still, some economists and policymakers already feel the nation is ready for its next rate hike. Japan’s inflation has stayed at or above BOJ’s target for 2½ years and the economy has continued a moderate recovery. Ahead of a policy meeting last week, some 86% of BOJ watchers said economic conditions justified a rate hike at the gathering. Naoki Tamura, a leading hawkish member of BOJ’s policy board, suggested raising the rate last week. He cited the economy staying on track with BOJ projections and increasing upside risks. Raising rates might also relieve some pressure from the yen, which is approaching levels that saw a government intervention in markets earlier in the year. Tokyo has spent close to $100 billion propping up the currency so far this year. Concern over Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s minority government securing support for an annual budget may be among the factors making policymakers at the central bank cautious about raising rates for now. A small opposition party that Ishiba hopes will support the ruling party’s budget plans has yet to fully back the initial proposals. Traders see a 46% chance of a rate hike in January as of Wednesday, with about an 82% chance of a move by March, according to the latest overnight-indexed-swap rates. This is Ueda’s last public speech scheduled in 2024. The BOJ board meets again to deliver a next policy decision on Jan. 24. \"I still think the odds are that the BOJ will hike rates in January,” said Kei Okamura, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. \"But clearly some investors are beginning to price in the chances of no rate hike as well.”'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Daiwa Securities is aiming to raise wages by at least 5%, its CEO has said, a faster rate than many Japanese firms expect as the country\\'s shrinking labor pool intensifies competition for talent. Daiwa is discussing a pay raise of at least 5% for the financial year beginning in April 2025, CEO Akihiko Ogino said, after hikes of 5%, 4% and 7% in the three years prior.  \"In order to secure quality talent, we have to raise wages above inflation,\" Ogino said. \"Every company has a shortage of workers.\" Daiwa is also considering increasing the starting monthly base wage — not including bonuses — for career-track employees to ¥300,000 ($1,920) from ¥290,000, subject to negotiations between employees and management. In April this year, large Japanese firms agreed to raise pay by 5.20% on average — the biggest rise in 33 years — at the \"shuntō\" spring wage negotiations. But the expected pay raise for April 2025 at Daiwa, Japan\\'s second-largest brokerage and investment bank, would likely exceed that of most other firms — only 9% of firms surveyed by Reuters in October said an increase between 5% and 7% was possible in the next financial year. Daiwa has also increased its intake of mid-career hires in the past two years. Ogino expects total experienced hires to hit 250 for the year ending in March 2025, up from 161 in the previous financial year and 147 the year before that.

       " {'title': 'Is Japan ready for 60 million tourists?',\n",
       "  'date': 'Dec 23, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'This month, Japan’s international tourism industry will close out a remarkable, record-breaking year. “All the (tourism) indicators are set to rise: contribution to the Japanese economy, increasing numbers and visitor spending,” says Julia Simpson, president and CEO of the World Travel & Tourism Council, adding that the economic benefit to Japan is expected to reach nearly ¥44.6 trillion ($291.5 billion), a 5.7% increase over the 2019 peak, while employment is forecasted to surpass 6 million jobs — 200,000 more than in the previous high point.  Spending by international visitors, meanwhile, is expected to reach ¥6.3 trillion by year end, which would surpass the 2019 level by 16%, according to the council’s 2024 Economic Impact Research. Arrivals, too, are expected to exceed the all-time high of 31.88 million visitors in 2019, based on data that Japan welcomed 30.19 million visitors between January and October (the latest month for which data is currently available). Japan’s performance this year has been impressive. Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific at U.N. Tourism Harry Hwang told delegates at Tourism Expo Japan, a trade show held in September, that Japan has been “leading the recovery” of international tourism in the Asia-Pacific region, pointing to record-breaking numbers of inbound visitors in the previous months.   Indeed, between July 2023 and June 2024, Japan attracted 31 million tourists, making it the best-performing market in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of visitor arrivals, according to the Central European Institute of Asian Studies (CEIAS), a think tank focusing on Europe-Asia relations and developments in the Indo-Pacific region. Simpson attributes Japan’s growth partly to the “positive exchange rate for international travelers” due to the weak yen, but CEIAS claims the strongest factor has been pent-up demand stemming from “revenge travel” after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted worldwide, as well as “more favorable visa policies, improved connectivity and increased government spending, such as its hosting of the World Expo in 2025.” The industry also benefited from the full resumption of some events and other activities that attract millions of tourists annually. Sapporo in February, for example, hosted its Snow Festival with all event sites in operation for the first time since the pandemic, while winter resorts experienced their first snow sports season with a full-lead time for bookings since the county’s border restrictions were fully relaxed in mid-October 2022.   Given the momentum, as well as national and local support to boost tourism, the industry is bracing for even more visitors, particularly as tourism recovery has yet to be realized in all parts of the country. Aviation data shows inbound airport traffic nationwide between April 2023 and March 2024 reached only 60% of the 2019 level. Most tourists arrived via airports in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, Sapporo and Okinawa, with many local hubs seeing fewer arrivals than pre-pandemic, largely due to the slow return of Chinese visitors. The concentration of visitors in a handful of areas, most noticeably Kyoto and Tokyo, is problematic not only for local residents. In an October survey of almost 8,000 international tourists by the Development Bank of Japan and the Japan Travel Bureau Foundation, 32% said they experienced congestion in the Japanese destinations they visited, 2% more than did in 2019. So given the government’s ambitious goal of welcoming 60 million inbound visitors annually by 2030, only five years away, how can the country manage tourism development? Crowds, traffic congestion and rubbish are among the common complaints by Japanese residents of having too many tourists in their areas, according to a 2024 study by Jalan Research Center, which specializes in tourism. In response, some hot spots have implemented new services and initiatives this year. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum introduced an online ticket system and extended its opening hours for visitors who book online in a bid to ease congestion. In Kyoto, where local residents reported difficulty accessing bus services due to the number of tourists and their luggage, the Municipal Transportation Bureau increased the frequency of buses in service and added new buses around areas home to popular sightseeing spots such as Kinkakuji, the Golden Pavillion. The government and tourism association also launched a dedicated “hands free bus” between Kyoto Station, hotels and other facilities in the city to encourage visitors to leave their luggage at their accommodation before beginning their sightseeing. The initiative is designed “to promote sustainable tourism in Kyoto that is in harmony with the lives of its residents,” according to the city.   Osaka, meanwhile, installed solar panel-powered bins to combat an increase in trash in popular tourist areas such as Dotonbori, the site of the city’s “Running Man” billboard, a renowned photo spot. Supported by a subsidy by the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism, the technology senses when rubbish is building up, compressing it by around 20% and alerting workers to empty bins before they are full. This summer also marked the inaugural use of gates at the fifth station of the Yoshida Trail on Mount Fuji, a measure that limits the number of climbers to 4,000 daily, and the implementation of a climbing fee of ¥2,000 per person. Citing the environmental damage caused by excessive crowds as well as the risks for “bullet climbers” who summit without breaks, Yamanashi Prefectural Gov. Kotaro Nagasaki said the moves would not only protect climbers and the iconic peak, but also “raise the satisfaction of people on the mountain at any one time.” Following the close of the climbing season, local data found that the moves had reduced the number of total climbers by 10% year-on-year to around 200,000. Nagasaki said the prefecture had also “managed to eliminate reckless climbing considerably.” Other measures to tackle problems caused by overtourism have been arguably less effective. Since a Lawson convenience store in Fujikawaguchiko began drawing attention due to its iconic backdrop featuring Mount Fuji, town officials have been trying to manage the international crowds causing a nuisance by jaywalking and blocking the road and sidewalk to take photos.   When multilingual notices were ignored, a 2.5-meter-high, 20-meter-long black screen was erected in the hope of blocking the view and, therefore, curbing antisocial behavior, only for visitors to continue coming and simply poking holes in the screen for photos. Undeterred, the town announced its “painful decision,” in November, to set up a fence about 6 meters long along the sidewalk in front of the store. National government steps to manage tourism congestion this year have focused on enticing international travelers to explore regions where visitors rarely tread. Indeed, studies show only a handful of historically popular areas in Japan experienced overtourism in 2024. By prefecture, the inbound tourist visit rate in 2023 was highest in Tokyo at 48.6%, followed by Osaka (43.5%), Chiba (36.1%), Kyoto (33.7%) and Fukuoka (13.4%). Every other destination in Japan, however, recorded a visit rate of single figures or less, according to data from the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO). Launched in April 2023, the government’s Tourism Nation Promotion Plan has three key pillars: to achieve more sustainable tourism, to boost tourism consumption by both international and domestic travelers, and to expand travel to less-trafficked areas. With the plan wrapping up in March 2026, efforts have reached their midpoint. So how has progress been so far and what’s still in store? In sustainability, the government has been “working hard” through measures such as “promoting lesser-known destinations across the country, fostering local collaboration and adopting innovative strategies to reduce congestion,” according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. The goal is for 100 regions to be “sustainable,” including 50 regions with international awards, by 2025. This year saw the needle move toward that level of international recognition. Green Destinations, a global non-profit organization, featured five Japanese regions in its Top 100 Stories, while U.N. Tourism named two Japanese destinations (Amagi, Kagoshima Prefecture, and Nishikawa, Yamagata Prefecture) as Best Tourism Villages, with another two selected to participate in the Best Tourism Villages Upgrade Programme.   Other targets of the Tourism Nation Promotion Plan have already been met. Increasing inbound consumption beyond the pre-pandemic record was achieved in 2023, when spending reached ¥5.29 trillion, exceeding the ¥4.81 trillion paid out in 2019. The target to surpass the annual number of international visitors recorded in 2019 is also likely to be achieved by year-end. Remaining tasks include encouraging international visitors to spend 320 million nights in regional areas by 2025, up from 300 million nights in 2019. “The number of overnight stays per foreign visitor in regional areas has not reached the target, leaving room especially for improving regional tourism promotion,” a JNTO spokesperson says. To support this, the organization would like to “enlarge” the adventure travel and luxury travel markets, as they are “very useful” in helping increase tourist numbers in regional areas, adds the spokesperson. Defined by the Adventure Travel Trade Association (ATTA) as involving physical activity, a connection to nature and the environment or an immersive cultural experience, adventure travel is growing globally, with a compound annual growth rate of 15.2% expected by 2030. Japan’s market is also expected to develop significantly from its nascent level over the same period.   At Asia’s first Adventure Travel World Summit, held in Hokkaido in September 2023, tourism minister Tetsuo Saito told delegates about Japan’s potential to develop adventure tourism, thanks to its “treasure trove” of resources. Building on the event’s success, JNTO partnered with the ATTA in November to host “Adventure Week” in Okinawa. The program for ATTA travel companies and select media offers opportunities to experience adventure travels specific to the destination with the aim of creating tours and generating media exposure. Many new adventure programs this year feature cultural experiences related to local food and drink, such as cooking, tastings and festivals. The growth coincides with government efforts to expand gastronomy tourism, a high-potential industry given that inbound visitors spent ¥1.2 trillion on food and drink in 2023, equating to almost one quarter of their total consumption, according to the Japan Tourism Agency. In April 2024, the agency launched financial subsidies for the development and promotion of programs focusing on regional culinary cultures in a bid to attract more international visitors to rural areas. In luxury travel, meanwhile, the public and private sectors are working to establish more high-end hotels across Japan, to stimulate regional tourism. A pilot project is underway to attract high-end hotels in four national parks, including Towada-Hachimantai National Park and Chubusangaku National Park, in northern and central Honshu, respectively. The work is part of a wider plan to establish at least one luxury resort hotel in each of the country’s 35 national parks by fiscal 2031.   “We recognize that it is essential to increase (the number of) visitors to regions other than Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, where 70% of luxury traveler spending was concentrated in 2019,” explained the JNTO spokesperson. So far, this year’s regional tourism promotion seems to be bearing fruit. More than 97% of international visitors or soon-to-be visitors to Japan expressed interest in exploring regional destinations in a 2024 poll by the Development Bank of Japan and the Japan Travel Bureau Foundation. Time will tell if Japan can successfully disperse the 60 million tourists expected annually across the country by 2030, thereby alleviating the kind of overtourism problems experienced in travel hot spots this year.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'As Japan nears new climate goal, criticism of policy process ramps up',\n",
       "  'date': 'Dec 10, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': \"The debate over the government’s recent draft proposal to reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2035 has spilled over into scrutiny over the decision-making process itself, with businesses, think tanks and civil society groups criticizing not only the proposed target but also the way in which the policy-setting panels are composed and run. The government is preparing to set the target as Japan’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), an emissions reduction commitment made by members of the United Nations climate framework's Paris Agreement. Japan currently has a goal to cut emissions by 46% in 2030 from 2013 levels and is targeting carbon neutrality by 2050.  These targets are arrived at via a web of committees, subcommittees and working groups spanning the Environment Ministry, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and the METI-affiliated Agency for Natural Resources and Energy. Critics charge that the process is essentially a rubber-stamping of a plan already decided upon by bureaucrats, and that the membership of at least some of the committees is biased toward those who support the status quo of an energy mix based on fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Such concerns were heightened when it emerged on Nov. 25 that a committee member had previously been blocked from presenting an opinion urging a far more ambitious emissions reduction target. “I think that incident really opened people's minds that this process is not really the process to discuss, (but a) process just to approve it,” said Kimiko Hirata, executive director of Climate Integrate, a think tank that earlier this year conducted an analysis of Japan’s energy policymaking process. “It's just a formalistic process, so that's the problem.” The groundwork for the NDC has been laid by a joint Environment Ministry-METI committee based on the Environment Ministry’s Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures and the Strategic Energy Plan formulated by METI. That energy plan is being compiled by the Strategic Policy Committee based on the work of numerous panels and groups, and has widespread implications not just for emissions reductions but also household utility bills, government spending and business competitiveness. Based on government guidelines, such panels should be fair and balanced in terms of experience and opinion, aim to have women make up at least 30% of the panel members, in principle avoid the appointment of the elderly and strictly limit the involvement of former government officials, among other considerations.   The main Environment Ministry-METI committee is seen as relatively balanced, yet Climate Integrate’s analysis published in April found that panels involved in formulating the Strategic Energy Plan skew male and elderly — at least 75% of the Strategic Policy Committee is 60 or older — and that the membership of several committees is dominated by those supporting fossil fuels and nuclear power, with people with vested interests more likely to be involved in less senior panels. “Most of the members are for nuclear and they are not really supportive of renewable energy, so the opinions we hear the most, quite often, are to endorse more gas ... or nuclear promotion,” Hirata said of the METI committees. The issue has begun to draw attention from parts of the business community. “In a way, this means that CO2 (carbon dioxide) emitters are making decarbonization policies,” Yusuke Matsuo, program director of the Japan Climate Leaders Partnership, a group of 252 businesses including Apple, Takashimaya, Takeda Pharmaceutical and Sekisui House, told reporters Dec. 3. “If I were an oil company representative called to a government panel, I would keep my company’s interests in mind. That would be my obligation, and I would be sued for a conflict of interest if I didn’t. So this is not about pointing a finger at members; it’s an issue of the (policymaking) mechanism.” Matsuo said energy policies should also reflect views from more diverse stakeholders, including young people, as well as farmers and fishers, who are being severely impacted by climate change. Masahiko Hikida, an official at the energy strategy office of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, which coordinates the Strategic Policy Committee, rebutted accusations that the makeup of the committee is unbalanced.   Hikida said METI’s stance hasn’t changed since May, when then-minister Ken Saito responded to a question in parliament from Tomo Iwabuchi of the Japanese Communist Party, who called on the ministry to involve a wider range of members of society, such as younger people, renewable energy providers and climate disaster victims, in the panel. “The Strategic Policy Committee includes as members academic experts and specialists necessary to conduct the discussions, from such fields as energy conservation, renewable energy and nuclear energy, and also from areas of the Japanese economy, energy-intensive industries, consumers, large and small companies, and finance (businesses),” Saito told a committee on economy, trade and industry in the Upper House. “The committee composition is well balanced,” he added. Regarding criticism that the committee doesn’t reflect the voices of young people, who will spend more of their lives in the world shaped by today’s climate policy, Hikida countered that the panel hosted representatives of youth groups — the Japan Youth Council, Climate Youth Japan and the Japan-America Student Conference — in September in order to listen to their views on energy and climate policy. The framing of discussions at the Strategic Policy Committee has also come in for criticism, with Renewables Energy Institute Executive Director Teruyuki Ohno pushing back against METI’s contention at a meeting on May 15 that Japan is “on track” with its emissions reductions, in contrast to the European Union. That determination is based on a trend starting in the fiscal year from April 2013, when Japan’s emissions were unusually high after nuclear power plants were shut down in the wake of the Fukushima meltdown. Moreover, gross emissions are used for the figure for that year, unlike the net emissions shown for subsequent years. Using the same 1990 starting point as for European countries reveals a much slower rate of reductions, Ohno wrote in July. Concerns over climate policymaking were crystalized on Nov. 25, when Shota Ikeda, president of the renewable energy provider Hachidori Solar and a member of the Environment Ministry-METI panel, told a meeting that he was prevented from calling for more ambitious emissions cuts of 75% by 2035 during a meeting the previous month. Due to scheduling conflicts, Ikeda had tried to have his opinion read out on his behalf, but he was asked to “withhold” expressing the viewpoint by an Environment Ministry official, he said. “As I was invited to join the NDC discussion this year, I was told that the government wants to discuss policies and measures with experts to achieve carbon neutrality in Japan by 2050,” he told the meeting. “I was asked to contribute frank opinions to create a meaningful forum, so I decided to participate, intending to give it my all. “In reality, it was not a ‘place for discussion,’ but only a three-minute presentation of public comments. Can we find the right direction by proceeding this way? ... It looks as if we’re just adding convenient comments to an existing scenario.”   Asked about the exchange at a news conference on Nov. 29, Environment Minister Keiichiro Asao denied the ministry tried to block Ikeda’s comment. “I checked with officials and confirmed that the intention was to ‘postpone’ the expression of his comment because it wasn’t in line with the agenda of the previous meeting,” he said. “We would like to proceed by listening to diverse opinions thoroughly while keeping time limitations in mind.” In terms of time limitations, Hirata pointed out that Nov. 25 was the first time the government had presented the new 2035 target, and that the proposal will likely be presented in a matter of weeks. “There's no time for us to think or to discuss,” Hirata said. Matsuo of the Japan Climate Leaders Partnership also said the speed of government discussions on the 2035 target picked up “at an unprecedented pace” in early November. While recognizing there isn’t much scope for significantly changing the NDC target or energy policy at this stage, Hirata nonetheless encourages the government to widen discussions beyond the existing committee structure, bringing in other groups as well as individuals such as members of parliament. “I think it's not too late for Japan to take stock and take some time to present something more openly and then have a broader discussion beyond the current committee,” Hirata said.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Japan\\'s wholesale inflation accelerated for three straight months as companies continued to pass on rising raw material and labor costs, data showed on Wednesday, keeping the central bank under pressure to raise interest rates again. The data for November comes ahead of the Bank of Japan\\'s two-day policy meeting ending on Dec. 19, when some analysts expect it to raise short-term interest rates from the current 0.25%.  The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, rose 3.7% last month from a year earlier, BOJ data showed, faster than a median market forecast for a 3.4% increase. The increase, which followed a 3.6% gain in October, was due to higher prices for food, nonferrous metals and plastic goods reflecting rising commodity and labor costs. The index, at 124.3, extended a record high for the third straight month. \"We\\'re seeing renewed inflationary pressure in domestic corporate goods prices,\" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. \"While consumption lacks momentum, real wages are no longer falling much. Given building inflationary pressure, there\\'s a good chance the BOJ could raise rates in December,\" he said. Agricultural and fishery goods prices spiked 31% in November from year-before levels, after a 28.1% gain in October, due largely to the soaring price of rice, the data showed. The yen-based import price index fell 1.2% in November, slower than a 2.2% drop in October, a sign the currency\\'s rebound has not been strong enough to significantly push down the cost of importing raw material. While the yen is off a three-decade low near ¥162 to the dollar hit in July, it has weakened to around ¥152 recently after touching a high near ¥141 in mid-September. The data casts doubt on the BOJ\\'s view that inflationary pressure from raw material imports will dissipate and ease the burden on households in a boost to consumption and the broader economy. Wholesale price data is seen as a leading indicator of consumer inflation, which the central bank uses as a benchmark in setting monetary policy. The BOJ ended a decade-long, radical stimulus program in March and raised short-term interest rates to 0.25% in July on the view Japan was progressing towards sustainably achieving its 2% inflation target. BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda has signaled readiness to hike rates again in the near-term if the bank becomes more convinced that inflation will stay around 2% backed by solid consumption and wage growth.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'As Japan nears new climate goal, criticism of policy process ramps up',\n",
       "  'date': 'Dec 10, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': \"The debate over the government’s recent draft proposal to reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2035 has spilled over into scrutiny over the decision-making process itself, with businesses, think tanks and civil society groups criticizing not only the proposed target but also the way in which the policy-setting panels are composed and run. The government is preparing to set the target as Japan’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), an emissions reduction commitment made by members of the United Nations climate framework's Paris Agreement. Japan currently has a goal to cut emissions by 46% in 2030 from 2013 levels and is targeting carbon neutrality by 2050.  These targets are arrived at via a web of committees, subcommittees and working groups spanning the Environment Ministry, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and the METI-affiliated Agency for Natural Resources and Energy. Critics charge that the process is essentially a rubber-stamping of a plan already decided upon by bureaucrats, and that the membership of at least some of the committees is biased toward those who support the status quo of an energy mix based on fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Such concerns were heightened when it emerged on Nov. 25 that a committee member had previously been blocked from presenting an opinion urging a far more ambitious emissions reduction target. “I think that incident really opened people's minds that this process is not really the process to discuss, (but a) process just to approve it,” said Kimiko Hirata, executive director of Climate Integrate, a think tank that earlier this year conducted an analysis of Japan’s energy policymaking process. “It's just a formalistic process, so that's the problem.” The groundwork for the NDC has been laid by a joint Environment Ministry-METI committee based on the Environment Ministry’s Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures and the Strategic Energy Plan formulated by METI. That energy plan is being compiled by the Strategic Policy Committee based on the work of numerous panels and groups, and has widespread implications not just for emissions reductions but also household utility bills, government spending and business competitiveness. Based on government guidelines, such panels should be fair and balanced in terms of experience and opinion, aim to have women make up at least 30% of the panel members, in principle avoid the appointment of the elderly and strictly limit the involvement of former government officials, among other considerations.   The main Environment Ministry-METI committee is seen as relatively balanced, yet Climate Integrate’s analysis published in April found that panels involved in formulating the Strategic Energy Plan skew male and elderly — at least 75% of the Strategic Policy Committee is 60 or older — and that the membership of several committees is dominated by those supporting fossil fuels and nuclear power, with people with vested interests more likely to be involved in less senior panels. “Most of the members are for nuclear and they are not really supportive of renewable energy, so the opinions we hear the most, quite often, are to endorse more gas ... or nuclear promotion,” Hirata said of the METI committees. The issue has begun to draw attention from parts of the business community. “In a way, this means that CO2 (carbon dioxide) emitters are making decarbonization policies,” Yusuke Matsuo, program director of the Japan Climate Leaders Partnership, a group of 252 businesses including Apple, Takashimaya, Takeda Pharmaceutical and Sekisui House, told reporters Dec. 3. “If I were an oil company representative called to a government panel, I would keep my company’s interests in mind. That would be my obligation, and I would be sued for a conflict of interest if I didn’t. So this is not about pointing a finger at members; it’s an issue of the (policymaking) mechanism.” Matsuo said energy policies should also reflect views from more diverse stakeholders, including young people, as well as farmers and fishers, who are being severely impacted by climate change. Masahiko Hikida, an official at the energy strategy office of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, which coordinates the Strategic Policy Committee, rebutted accusations that the makeup of the committee is unbalanced.   Hikida said METI’s stance hasn’t changed since May, when then-minister Ken Saito responded to a question in parliament from Tomo Iwabuchi of the Japanese Communist Party, who called on the ministry to involve a wider range of members of society, such as younger people, renewable energy providers and climate disaster victims, in the panel. “The Strategic Policy Committee includes as members academic experts and specialists necessary to conduct the discussions, from such fields as energy conservation, renewable energy and nuclear energy, and also from areas of the Japanese economy, energy-intensive industries, consumers, large and small companies, and finance (businesses),” Saito told a committee on economy, trade and industry in the Upper House. “The committee composition is well balanced,” he added. Regarding criticism that the committee doesn’t reflect the voices of young people, who will spend more of their lives in the world shaped by today’s climate policy, Hikida countered that the panel hosted representatives of youth groups — the Japan Youth Council, Climate Youth Japan and the Japan-America Student Conference — in September in order to listen to their views on energy and climate policy. The framing of discussions at the Strategic Policy Committee has also come in for criticism, with Renewables Energy Institute Executive Director Teruyuki Ohno pushing back against METI’s contention at a meeting on May 15 that Japan is “on track” with its emissions reductions, in contrast to the European Union. That determination is based on a trend starting in the fiscal year from April 2013, when Japan’s emissions were unusually high after nuclear power plants were shut down in the wake of the Fukushima meltdown. Moreover, gross emissions are used for the figure for that year, unlike the net emissions shown for subsequent years. Using the same 1990 starting point as for European countries reveals a much slower rate of reductions, Ohno wrote in July. Concerns over climate policymaking were crystalized on Nov. 25, when Shota Ikeda, president of the renewable energy provider Hachidori Solar and a member of the Environment Ministry-METI panel, told a meeting that he was prevented from calling for more ambitious emissions cuts of 75% by 2035 during a meeting the previous month. Due to scheduling conflicts, Ikeda had tried to have his opinion read out on his behalf, but he was asked to “withhold” expressing the viewpoint by an Environment Ministry official, he said. “As I was invited to join the NDC discussion this year, I was told that the government wants to discuss policies and measures with experts to achieve carbon neutrality in Japan by 2050,” he told the meeting. “I was asked to contribute frank opinions to create a meaningful forum, so I decided to participate, intending to give it my all. “In reality, it was not a ‘place for discussion,’ but only a three-minute presentation of public comments. Can we find the right direction by proceeding this way? ... It looks as if we’re just adding convenient comments to an existing scenario.”   Asked about the exchange at a news conference on Nov. 29, Environment Minister Keiichiro Asao denied the ministry tried to block Ikeda’s comment. “I checked with officials and confirmed that the intention was to ‘postpone’ the expression of his comment because it wasn’t in line with the agenda of the previous meeting,” he said. “We would like to proceed by listening to diverse opinions thoroughly while keeping time limitations in mind.” In terms of time limitations, Hirata pointed out that Nov. 25 was the first time the government had presented the new 2035 target, and that the proposal will likely be presented in a matter of weeks. “There's no time for us to think or to discuss,” Hirata said. Matsuo of the Japan Climate Leaders Partnership also said the speed of government discussions on the 2035 target picked up “at an unprecedented pace” in early November. While recognizing there isn’t much scope for significantly changing the NDC target or energy policy at this stage, Hirata nonetheless encourages the government to widen discussions beyond the existing committee structure, bringing in other groups as well as individuals such as members of parliament. “I think it's not too late for Japan to take stock and take some time to present something more openly and then have a broader discussion beyond the current committee,” Hirata said.\"},\n",

       " {'title': 'Turning tempura oil into fuel: 30 years of environmental efforts by Tokyo entrepreneur',\n",
       "  'date': 'Nov 27, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'This is a sponsored story, created and edited exclusively by Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s Tokyo Updates website.  \"Turning Tokyo into an oil field\" — president Yumi Someya of U\\'s Corporation has been working to protect the environment with this resolution. We spoke to her about her past efforts and hopes for the future.  In 1991, Someya joined her family business, Someya Shoten, which collected old cooking oil used to make dishes like tempura, refined it and sold it for industrial use. The reason she decided to join came from an experience she had traveling around Asia after graduating from high school. \"When I crossed the border from Tibet to Nepal, I had a narrow escape from a landslide. The locals said it was a man-made disaster, not a natural one.\" The ground in the area had become loose due to deforestation resulting from urban development, leading to the landslide. After this experience, her interest in the environment grew, and she joined Someya Shoten.   Most of the used cooking oil from households is disposed of by solidifying it or by absorbing it with paper or cloth but, if used effectively, it can reduce waste and contribute to recycling. \"Seeing all the used cooking oil being collected, I thought Tokyo is basically an oil field.\" Then she had an idea: increasing the recovery rate of used cooking oil could further reduce its impact on the environment. In 1993, she succeeded in developing the world\\'s first biodiesel fuel (BDF) made from used cooking oil, which has virtually no sulfur oxide emissions, reducing air pollution. It can be used as a fuel for diesel vehicles, and she started to use it to run her collection trucks. In 1997, she established U\\'s Corporation and 10 years later launched Tokyo Yuden 2017, yuden meaning oil field. It is a project that aims to collect and recycle all the used cooking oil in Tokyo. The company started to promote a shift to a recycling-based society, such as providing BDF-generated electricity to music festivals and environmental events.   However, a legislative change in 2009 imposed restrictions on the use of BDF as a vehicle fuel. In 2016, Someya established Tokyo Yu Denryoku, which developed a generator that runs on used cooking oil and began selling electricity. \"We aimed to provide electricity that\\'s locally produced and locally consumed by generating it from oil used in Tokyo.\" The business grew steadily, but the price of used cooking oil soared due to energy prices rising in the wake of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, and the company had to stop selling electricity. \"The truth is, I felt powerless despite all the efforts I had made to get to where I was. That said, people are still going to produce used cooking oil, so there\\'s still an opportunity. That\\'s why I focused on collecting used cooking oil.\" Over the past few years, there has been a new growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from bio feedstocks including used cooking oil. SAF is a clean fuel that has significantly fewer carbon emissions than petroleum-based jet fuel. Countries such as Norway mandate the use of aviation fuel mixed with SAF. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government also launched a project to promote the commercialization of biofuel. It supports ANA Holdings Inc. using SAF to operate flights between Haneda Airport and Hachijojima, a Pacific island that is part of Tokyo Metropolis.   Carried by this momentum, Someya started to export the collected used cooking oil to Singapore, which has SAF manufacturing plants. Japan is also aiming to produce SAF domestically, which would further boost the recycling of used cooking oil. \"We have had many twists and turns, but I want to see Tokyo become an oil field. Environmental issues cannot be avoided, and social awareness has changed dramatically from 30 years ago when I declared that I would start an environmental business. We are now in an age where businesses cannot be viable without considering the environment. I believe that Tokyo\\'s oil field won\\'t dry up as long as there are people around.\" The Tokyo oil field project is changing, but it keeps going strong.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump may impose tariffs on Japanese cars exported to the United States, Stefan Angrick, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a recent interview. Angrick warned that this poses a huge risk to the Japanese economy.  During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to impose blanket tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imported goods. Given the U.S. trade deficit, he may focus attention on Japanese auto exports. Still, Angrick said that such tariffs are unlikely to be realized as they could fuel inflation in the United States. Noting that Japan is the world's largest investor in the United States, he predicted that possible tariff hikes would be limited if Japanese automakers promise to expand investment and shift production to the United States. Meanwhile, the economist expressed concern about a resumption of the tit-for-tat tariff war between the United States and China, as officials in the new U.S. administration are expected to include hardliners against China, adding that it would inevitably hit the Japanese economy. If tariffs push up import prices and reignite inflation in the United States, the Federal Reserve would be forced to keep interest rates high, Angrick pointed out. In that case, the Bank of Japan would have to accelerate the pace of rate hikes, he noted.\"},\n",

Many in the nine-member board highlighted the need to scrutinize market developments, particularly yen moves, in determining whether the economy can weather higher borrowing costs, the summary showed.  While the risk of a U.S. hard landing has subsided, the BOJ must spend time scrutinizing market developments \"as it was too early to conclude markets will restore calm,\" one member said. Another member said the BOJ must \"take time and exercise caution\" when raising rates. Others, however, saw the need to communicate clearly the BOJ\\'s resolve to continue raising rates if its economic and price forecasts are met, the summary showed. \"The Bank should consider further rate hikes after pausing to assess developments in the U.S. economy,\" one member was quoted as saying, adding that Japan\\'s economy no longer needed substantial monetary support.

       " {'title': 'Japan’s biggest base pay gains in 31 years support case for rate hikes',\n",
       "  'date': 'Nov 7, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'Japanese workers’ base salaries have seen the largest increase in over three decades, supporting the Bank of Japan’s view that the economy remains on a recovery track and backing the case for a rate hike in coming months. The pace of gains in base pay quickened to 2.6% year on year in September, versus a 2.4% clip in August, the labor ministry reported Thursday. The advance was the strongest in over 31 years.  Nominal cash earnings increased by 2.8%, missing the consensus estimate of 3%, while a more stable measure of wage trends that excludes bonuses and overtime and avoids sampling issues registered 2.9% growth for full-time workers, accelerating slightly from the previous month’s 2.8%. In a less favorable development, real wages fell for a second straight month even as price gains slowed in September after the government resumed subsidies to reduce household gas and electricity bills. Taken together, Thursday’s data show that wage hike momentum remains largely steady despite pockets of weakness, sending a positive signal to authorities hoping to see a cycle in which rising wages fuel spending and spur demand-led inflation. While the central bank kept rates on hold at its policy meeting last week, Gov. Kazuo Ueda reaffirmed his view that Japan is on track to meet its inflation target, pointing to the possibility of another rate hike further down the road. \"There’s no doubt that wages are improving,” said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute. \"The trend is improving as expected toward another rate hike.” Nearly half of economists surveyed last month by Bloomberg said they expect the bank to raise the benchmark rate in December, while another 32% predicted the move would come in January. \"The data support our view that the BOJ will raise rates further in January, when it will have seen more evidence that the U.S. economy is making a soft landing and will probably be encouraged by signs the domestic wage-price cycle continues to build momentum,” Bloomberg economist Taro Kimura said.  The future of wage growth will depend on the outcome of the next round of annual negotiations between unions and corporate employers, which kicked off a month ago. Japan’s largest labor union group, Rengo, said it will seek gains of at least 5% in the talks, maintaining the same goal it set for the current fiscal year. The group ultimately secured an average salary gain of 5.1% this year, the largest increase in over 30 years. Wage increases for workers at small and medium-size firms and for part-time workers may play a crucial role in determining whether momentum holds, according to Rengo’s chair Tomoko Yoshino. After the BOJ stood pat on policy on Oct. 31, Ueda said at his postdecision news conference that it would generally be beneficial for the economy if next year’s wage increases remained on par with this year’s results. He noted that the bank won’t base any rate decisions solely on the results of wage talks, but he’s also said that this year’s wage gains were a key factor in the bank’s March decision to end its negative rate policy. Also, Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election has helped weaken the yen, raising the risk of fueling inflation. \"The BOJ is more focused on the currency rather than domestic factors, such as the economy and prices,” said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research & Technologies. He added that the BOJ could raise interest rates as soon as December if a weaker yen adds pressure on the central bank. Import-driven inflation also risks dampening consumer sentiment after private spending rose for the first time in five quarters in the three months through June. The gross domestic figures for the summer quarter will be released next week, which will indicate whether the recovery in consumption continued. Thursday’s wage data partly reflects continuing tightness in Japan’s labor market. In September, the job-to-applicant ratio rose, and the unemployment rate fell to 2.4% — the lowest since January. In its latest quarterly outlook report, the BOJ indicated that continued tightening of labor market conditions may keep underpinning employee incomes.'},\n",

As for the global economic outlook, Srinivasan stressed that downside risks are rising on the back of geoeconomic fragmentation and a slowdown in the Chinese economy, warning that an increasing number of trade restrictions could undermine economic growth in export-oriented Asia.

In May 2018, the JICA employee allegedly leaked estimated project costs and the Philippine government\\'s personnel plan for the MRT Line 3 renovation project in Manila, funded by a yen loan from Japan, according to a report by the Yomiuri Shimbun. JICA is responsible for most of Japan\\'s overseas aid known as the official development assistance (ODA).  The employee reportedly intended to secure in advance a contractor that would be successful in bidding to prevent delays in the ¥38.1 billion project. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazuhiko Aoki confirmed during a news conference on Tuesday that information regarding the project was leaked. “The government takes the occurrence of the information leak seriously and will closely supervise JICA\\'s measures to prevent a recurrence,” he said. In an email sent to the Tokyo consulting company on the day Manila announced it would solicit bids for the project, the JICA employee thanked the company and called the project \"the fastest in JICA\\'s history,\" the daily newspaper reported Wednesday. The email was apparently sent under the assumption that the firm would participate in the bid and that the process from there on would be smooth, the newspaper said. Shortly before the leak occurred, Japan’s Foreign Ministry had released details of the yen loan for the project, including an interest rate of 0.1% and a repayment period of 40 years. In July, JICA announced a one-month suspension for an employee who leaked confidential procurement information. The total amount of ODA extended to the Philippines from 2017 through 2021 was $11.3 billion, according to government data.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Japan saw the highest number of bankruptcies since 2013 in the six months through September, as companies were increasingly hit by rising costs. Some 4,990 firms went bankrupt in that period, increasing 18.6% from the previous year, according to a report by Teikoku Databank on Tuesday. The number of firms going under in Japan has continued to increase since the second half of the year ending March 2022.  The jump in bankruptcies partly reflects the impact of higher prices, particularly for small companies. A record 472 out of the 4,990 firms cited inflation as the main reason they went bankrupt, the report showed. The country’s key price gauge has stayed at or above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target for over two years, as the weak yen has inflated import costs for everything from food to energy. Construction, manufacturing and retail were among the sectors that had the highest number of cost-driven bankruptcies, according to the report. Beyond rising prices, a record 163 firms cited labor shortages as a reason for their struggles. Japan’s unemployment rate has remained below 3% for over three years — the lowest level among developed economies. The tighter labor market puts pressure on companies to boost salaries to retain their employees, further straining their budgets. While some Japanese companies successfully offered more than a 5% wage increase for their workers in pay negotiations earlier this year, many small and medium sized firms have reported difficulties in following suit. Looking ahead, another potential risk for companies is higher debt-servicing costs following the Bank of Japan’s interest rate hikes in March and July.

       "  'date': 'Oct 6, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\\'s recent remark signaling opposition to interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan has taken the financial market by surprise, as he had been viewed as a proponent of rate hikes. The market is being perplexed by the statement by Ishiba, who had been critical of Abenomics, the late former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\\'s economic policy mix, which included massive monetary easing.  Ishiba had long voiced criticisms regarding the side effects of the BOJ\\'s prolonged large-scale monetary easing, saying that \"the Japanese economy will not be cured with unprecedented monetary accommodation.\" Investor concerns about Ishiba\\'s economic policies grew after he beat former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi in a runoff in the leadership election of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Sept. 27. Takaichi, who led the first round of voting in the election, supports the continuation of the Abenomics policies. The concerns caused Japan\\'s benchmark 225-issue Nikkei average to plunge over 1,900 points Monday, the first business day after the LDP election, in a phenomenon called the \"Ishiba shock.\" The prime minister met with BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda on the evening of Wednesday, one day after he took office. After the meeting, Ishiba told reporters that he does not believe the country is currently in an environment warranting an additional interest rate hike. This led to a rapid weakening of the yen and a jump in stock prices the following day. \"He apparently corrected course to avoid being viewed as a rate hike proponent\" ahead of the Oct. 27 election for the House of Representatives, the all-important lower chamber of Japan\\'s parliament, a senior official at an economy-related government agency said. Ishiba\\'s remark is viewed as possibly undermining the BOJ\\'s independence from the government. While central banks tend to face government pressure for easing monetary policies, the BOJ law ensures the independence of the Japanese central bank\\'s monetary policy. \"It may have been a careless mistake by the prime minister, who is not familiar with economic policy management,\" Ryutaro Kono, chief economist at BNP Paribas Securities (Japan), said of the statement Ishiba made after the meeting with Ueda. A prime minister \"should refrain from making remarks that could violate the BOJ law,\" Kono added. Kono expressed concern that the yen may weaken further if many people come to believe that the BOJ cannot increase interest rates due to political pressure, leading to consumers suffering from further inflation as a result. Ishiba explained Thursday night that his remark in question had indicated that he was in agreement with Ueda, who told him in the Wednesday meeting that there is ample time to consider future interest rate hikes. \"A situation in which a remark from the prime minister causes financial markets to move wildly should be avoided,\" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. Former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Ishiba\\'s immediate predecessor, had not intervened significantly in Ueda\\'s efforts to normalize monetary policy. \"With Kishida, who appointed (Ueda as BOJ governor), gone, we will have to explore how to deal with the new (Ishiba) administration,\" a senior BOJ official said.

       "  'content': 'A divergence is emerging among leveraged funds on their positions in the yen ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan meetings that will dictate the currency’s near-term trajectory. The yen’s dramatic start to the week, which saw it briefly surge beyond the closely watched ¥140 per dollar line, has triggered a rethink for investors. Some short-term funds locked in profits ahead of the monetary policy decisions this week, while others are looking to increase their long-yen positions on bets for a large interest-rate cut by the Fed.  \"We have seen some longer-term players squaring up the long-yen positions they put on earlier,” said Antony Foster, head of Group-of-10 spot trading at Nomura Holdings in London. \"But there is still speculative interest in adding to downside dollar and cross-yen positions.” The yen has gained more than 4% this month versus the dollar amid expectations the U.S. central bank will start cutting interest rates this week. It was trading around ¥140 to the dollar in Tokyo trading Tuesday. The risk for funds holding long-yen positions against the dollar into the decision is that the Fed doesn’t make a large cut, which could see the dollar rebound. Swap markets are pricing in about a 70% probability of a 50 basis-point Fed rate cut on Wednesday. \"The dollar and dollar spot index have been under pressure as the market pricing has gotten to quite extreme levels,” said Martin Whetton, Sydney-based head of financial markets strategy at Westpac Banking. \"The risk in the short term is the market gets some sort of disappointment, which may lead to position unwinds across various asset classes.”'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Japan real wages unexpectedly rise, keeping BOJ on hike path',\n",
       "  'date': 'Sep 5, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'Japanese workers’ real wages rose for a second consecutive month in July, keeping the central bank on track for another potential rate hike later this year. Real cash earnings for workers climbed 0.4% in July from a year earlier, the labor ministry reported Thursday. While the pace of gains slowed from the previous month’s increase, the result beat the consensus call for a 0.6% decline and followed the first advance in 27 months in June. Nominal wages grew 3.6%, also outpacing the consensus estimate.  The yen strengthened to as strong as ¥143.19 against the dollar following the data release, taking gains to as much as 0.4% for the day. Base salaries experienced strong growth, rising 2.7%, the largest gain in 31 years. A more stable measure of wage trends that avoids sampling problems and excludes bonuses and overtime showed wages for full-time workers increased by a record 3%. Thursday’s data are an indication that a key peg of the virtuous cycle long sought by Bank of Japan Gov. Kazuo Ueda may be falling into place. The BOJ has said it expects wage gains to fuel demand-led inflation, a condition it needs to confirm as it continues along the path toward normalizing policy after maintaining ultraeasy settings for decades. \"Ueda’s comments indicate that he still wants to raise interest rates,” said Masato Koike, economist at Sompo Institute Plus. \"Assuming no further market turmoil, and given that wage growth will provide significant support, the likelihood of a rate hike before the end of the year has increased considerably.” Almost all economists expect the BOJ to stand pat when the board next sets policy on Sept. 20. Most expect a move sometime between October and January after the BOJ conducted its second rate hike this year on July 31. Ueda has said the bank would consider additional tightening steps if the economy and prices develop in line with the bank’s projections. The gain in real wages will create a positive backdrop as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party chooses a new leader. Given its dominance in parliament, the LDP’s Sept. 27 election is all but certain to determine the nation’s next premier after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced his decision to step down. Kishida resigned after persistently low approval ratings that partly reflected voter dissatisfaction over the failure of wages to keep up with rising prices. Thursday’s strong data was driven largely by the historic wage gains that resulted from annual wage negotiations between the nation’s largest umbrella group for unions and employers. The union group, Rengo, secured wage increases of more than 5% for its constituents, the largest gains in more than 30 years. The BOJ has said in the past that over 80% of wage increases agreed for a new fiscal year tend to be reflected in data by July. \"For policy, the wage data increase our conviction that a rate hike will be on the table at the October meeting — though uncertainty over the pace of the U.S. slowdown means it’s not a clear-cut call,” Bloomberg economist Taro Kimura said. Japan’s chronic labor shortage is likely to keep upward pressure on wages, the BOJ said in its latest Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices. Japan’s large service sector firms are facing the worst workforce constraints in 32 years, according to the BOJ’s June tankan report. Companies have reported relatively robust results in the latest quarter, suggesting they have some leeway to keep rewarding workers. Some 64% of companies in the Topix index beat earnings expectations in the latest quarter, while 33% missed, a better ratio than the previous period, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. While inflation remains at a relatively high level, having hit or hovered above the BOJ’s 2% target for more than two years, there are also signs of improving consumer sentiment. Consumption turned positive for the first time in five quarters in the April-June period, partly supported by recent wage gains and the government’s tax rebate initiative. Revised gross domestic product figures incorporating the latest data will be released on Monday.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The turmoil triggered by the Bank of Japan’s recent interest rate hike has produced two more entries for the record book: All time highs for both inflows and outflows in the nation’s stocks last week. Global investors were net buyers of Japanese stocks in the week ending Aug. 9 as trading recovered from an historic rout. Gross sales totaled ¥31.3 trillion ($210 billion), the most since at least 2005, preliminary data from the Ministry of Finance showed. Gross purchases were ¥31.9 trillion, also a record over the same period, making them net buyers.  Separate data from Japan Exchange Group Inc. later showed that including futures, foreign investors were net sellers, offloading ¥777.2 billion, while domestic institutions bought the most since March 2023. The Nikkei 225-issue average slumped 12% on Aug. 5, the biggest percentage fall since Black Monday in 1987, before rebounding 10% the next day. The data underscores overseas investors’ strong appetite for Japanese equities even after the unwinding of yen-funded carry trades sent shock waves through broader markets.

       " {'title': '$6.4 trillion stock wipeout has traders fearing ‘great unwind’ is just starting',\n",
       "  'date': 'Aug 6, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'The numbers flashing on trading screens on Monday were shocking even to market veterans. In Tokyo, the Nikkei was down 12%. In Seoul, the Kospi sank 9%. And when the opening bell rang in New York, the Nasdaq plunged 6% in seconds. Cryptocurrencies sank; the VIX, a gauge of stock market volatility, skyrocketed; and investors piled into Treasury bonds, the safest asset of them all.  Whether Monday’s wild gyrations mark the final bang of a global selloff that started to build last week or signal the beginning of a protracted slump is impossible to know. But one thing is clear: the pillars that had underpinned financial-market gains for years — a series of key assumptions that investors across the world were banking on — have been shaken. They look, in hindsight, a bit naive: the U.S. economy is unstoppable; artificial intelligence will quickly revolutionize business everywhere; Japan will never hike interest rates — or not enough to really matter. Rapid-fire, evidence poured in over the past couple weeks that undermined each of them. The July jobs report was feeble in the U.S. So too were Big Tech’s AI-driven quarterly earnings. And the Bank of Japan hiked rates for the second time this year. The one-two-three punch jolted investors into suddenly seeing the peril inherent in, say, bidding Nvidia shares up 1,100% in less than two years or loading up on junk-rated loans bundled into bonds or borrowing money in Japan and plowing it into assets paying 11% in Mexico. In the span of three weeks, some $6.4 trillion has now been erased from global stock markets.   \"It’s the great unwind,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore. In the vernacular of traders, trying to pick the right moment to buy an asset that’s tumbling is like trying to catch a falling knife. Today, Varathan said, \"there are falling knives everywhere.” A market panic like this creates risks big and small. Most prominent among them: the selloff, if left unchecked long enough, could muck up the gears of the financial system, slow lending and act as the final straw that tips the global economy into the recession that many now fear. That prompted calls for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates — perhaps, some argued, even before the next scheduled policy meeting in September. In the bond market, the rush into shorter-dated Treasuries briefly drove yields on two-year notes below those on 10-year bonds for the first time in over two years. Known as a disinversion, that flipped the yield curve back to its usual shape again — a shift that’s typically seen as a sign of an imminent recession. For Ed Yardeni, an economist who’s closely tracked markets for half a century, the sudden collapse in markets brought back memories of Black Monday in 1987 — a one-day plunge that shaved 23% off the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It was scary but, Yardeni notes, ultimately not a harbinger of economic doom. Back then, \"the implication was that we were in or about to fall into recession and that didn’t happen at all,” Yardeni, who runs Yardeni Research, said on Bloomberg TV. \"It had really more to do with the internals of the market. I think there’s the same thing going on here.” Markets have been rocked by premature recession fears during the current bull market, too. They flared early last year during a short-lived banking panic, only to fade away almost as quickly when the U.S. economy kept powering ahead. The stock market also bounced back strongly from the drubbing it took in 2022 to hover at record highs this year. But the shift in sentiment across the globe has been stark in recent days, shattering the usual late-summer lull and roiling vacation plans.   As losses piled up across markets, Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, rushed back to the place he was renting in London and whipped out his laptop. He was there on vacation with his family but those plans were out now. Like Yardeni, he too remembers the 1987 crash and the jolt it gave him and said he felt a bit of a deja vu Monday morning. \"You don’t wake up every day like this,” Maley said. \"I remember how things got in 1987.” The forces that unleashed Monday’s turmoil had been steadily building for weeks. In early July — just as tech stocks were hitting a peak — the Japanese yen began appreciating sharply as investors positioned for the Bank of Japan to join other central banks in pulling back its flood of monetary stimulus. That drove traders to unwind so-called carry trades, which involve borrowing relatively cheaply in Japan and investing elsewhere, to preserve profits they made. This in turn exerted selling pressure on markets worldwide as borrowed money was returned. That was followed by a steady drumbeat of earnings reports that fanned worries that the big tech stocks — which had driven much of the recent rally — had run up too far, with companies yet to reap any profit bonanza from the massive investments in artificial intelligence. Amazon.com and Intel both plunged after disappointing results.   At the same time, the bond market kept flashing increasing worries and data signaled that parts of the economy were starting to cool. By Wednesday — when the Fed held rates steady at a more than two-decade high and the BOJ tightened policy — bonds had already rallied. Then on Friday they gained further after the unemployment rate rose and job growth came in well short of forecasts. Across Wall Street, economists started predicting that the Fed would need to swoop in with half-point cuts or act between meetings — the kind of step usually reserved for a crisis. Shoki Omori arrived at Mizuho Securities\\' Otemachi offices at 6 a.m. on Monday ready for big market swings. But even he was surprised at the scale of the selloff. As the yen skyrocketed 3%, a result of the BOJ’s rate hikes, the Nikkei index tumbled throughout the session. At day’s end, it had fallen the most since 1987. \"This blew all my expectations,” said Omori, the chief desk strategist in Tokyo. \"We’re heading into some unimaginable trading territory here. Brace for more.” The losses went on to ripple through other Asian markets and into Europe, where major stock indexes slumped, and then into the Americas. It seeped into credit markets too, with at least two companies — wireless infrastructure provider SBA Communications and theme park operator SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment — postponing loan deals worth a combined $3.8 billion. By late afternoon in the U.S., stocks recovered from their low, leaving the Nasdaq Composite Index down 3.4%, and the bond market had steadied. But that did little to calm rattled traders who were hesitant to chalk this up as just another false alarm. \"I’m still concerned,” said Maley, the strategist at Miller Tabak. \"We’re still worried about earnings and the economy.”'},\n",

Shaun McKenna 00:09 Welcome to Deep Dive from The Japan Times. I\\'m your host, Shaun McKenna, and I\\'m sitting in a pub in a place called Golden Gai. The pub is called Hip, and this is a section of a neighborhood known as Kabukicho in Tokyo central Shinjuku Ward. With me is my producer, Dave Cortez and Japan Times staff writer Alex K.T. Martin. Alex Martin 00:28 Hey, Shaun. Dave Cortez 00:29 Hey there. Shaun McKenna 0:30 So Alex, on today\\'s show, we\\'re going to be talking about some issues that have been making the news in this area over the past half year. But first, I want to talk to you a little bit about Golden Gai, which is located in the southeast corner of Kabukicho. This is an area that\\'s kind of got a somewhat seedy reputation among Japanese people. Alex Martin 00:49 Well, yeah, I guess, I guess the word \"Kabukicho\" would oftentimes conjure up the image of red-light districts, sex work, host clubs. But Golden Gai is different, though. Although the address is the same, it\\'s a completely different world down here. Golden Gai itself is six narrow alleys housed with about 280 different drinking establishments, bars, some restaurants, snack bars, as they call them in Japanese, where, you know, female hostesses, greet you and it\\'s, you know, it\\'s been a popular destination for half a century or more. A lot of office workers, after they finish their day, they come over here. Artists come over here. You know, painters, rock ’n’ roll band folks, people like that. So it draws a really widespread clientele from all over the place and the bar. And we\\'re right now Hip, h-i-p, as in, “hip hip hooray,” so I interviewed the owner of this place last December, called Kambayashi-san. He owns another bar downstairs, Skavla, which is quite foreigner friendly. They have their menu in English. This is another place he opened before that, called hip this, I think, sort of caters more towards the local sort of population, you know, people around us, like Tonomura-san sitting next to us. He says he actually moved his home near Golden Gai so he can drink here every night for fun. Shaun McKenna 02:07 You can hear them in the background speaking. Alex Martin 02:10 So I had this place in mind when you asked me to do a story about Golden Gai. Shaun McKenna 02:14 Right, last year at the holidays, we did this piece titled “Christmas in Shinjuku Golden Gai,” and for that piece, you kind of went into the history of this area a little bit. Can you talk a little bit more about that history today? Alex Martin 02:26 So, Golden Gai in Japanese means “golden street,” “gai” is “street.” This area sort of popped up, like a lot of other areas in Tokyo, like Ueno, for example, as a black market after World War II but eventually, the U.S. occupation forces abolished the black markets. And in the late-1950s, or up until the late 1950s, it was known as a place for drinks and prostitution actually, right? So a lot of these bars and these Nagaya tenements actually have three floors, and the top floor would be called the “chon-no-ma,” where sex workers would indulge in their work, right? That\\'s not the case anymore. In 1958, there was a law that banned prostitution and, since then, it sort of transformed into a very artsy sort of neighborhood, which still is the case. But back in the day you would have like these big shot playwrights, novelists, painters, movie directors — you know... Shaun McKenna 03:21 You’re talking about, like, the 1960s, 1960s-1970s, even till the ’80s, ’90s, before the bubble popped. Alex Martin 03:26 I think when the asset price bubble popped, this whole area was quite desolated, as well as other sort of like, you know, commercial neighborhoods in Tokyo and elsewhere. But it\\'s been revived since then. So I guess, sort of an important moment in the history of this place was back in the 1960s and ’70s. It sort of became more of an artist’s quarter. So a lot of writers hang out here and, in fact, in January 1976, I think, the news broke that a writer called Ryuzo Saki, he was a Golden Gai regular, his book called “Vengeance is Mine” — it\\'s about ... it\\'s a nonfiction book about a serial killer, If I\\'m not mistaken — it won the Naoki Prize. Maybe it wasn\\'t nonfiction, it was based on a story about the serial killer. And it was seen basically as a victory for the whole neighborhood, which was sort of under the spotlight till then, but now it really sprung into the national media. Shaun McKenna 04:16 Basically, OK, so let\\'s set the scene. It\\'s, like, now the 1980s and Japan is in the waning days of the bubble economy. You know, city pop artists rule the charts ... what\\'s going on in Golden Gai at that time? Alex Martin 04:27 So, like it was, you know, in other neighborhoods in Tokyo, land prices started really climbing really high. But a lot of the property owners here, they were able to hold on to their little slices of land, but there was, like, massive pressure for them to sell from loan sharks and all that. But then, so it became desolate. Over the early 1990s or so, a lot of the bars went closed. I talked to a couple of long-time regulars in this neighborhood who actually began coming here during that period. They said, like, it\\'s nothing like what it is now. It was like, you know, half the alleys are dark, you know, people just couldn\\'t afford, you know, operating in this neighborhood, the economy is really bad. But then towards the 1990s, it sort of sees, starts seeing, like a revival, especially during the 2000s. I think (due to) this retro appeal, you know, you don\\'t see a place like this anywhere else in Japan. Basically it\\'s like this, you know, you do see like, you know, simple alleys in Tokyo or other big cities, or even in the countryside that has this kind of feeling. But, you know, 280 bars concentrated in one single neighborhood — I don\\'t think there\\'s anything like it anywhere else in Japan. So it\\'s sort of like, you know, became a very charismatic, popular neighborhood, especially for the artsy types as well as everybody else. And now, you know, I think it\\'s basically regained its footing over the past five or six years. So tourists have been coming here in, like, more crazy numbers. Shaun McKenna 05:43 I think, I think it\\'s an important point to make, because, you know, you kind of get that even coming here today, you saw a lot of people like, kind of just taking pictures of empty alleyways and and you don\\'t really get that in other parts of the city. And I could imagine, especially in the ’90s, there was this effort from Tokyo, to try to, like, distance themselves from the past. But this is a place that embraces it and even though, you know, you were saying in your article that since the 2000s a lot of stores have like, kind of changed hands, and they\\'ve like, opened up, it\\'s almost like a second or maybe third generation of store owners, you know, it still kind of maintains this utter charm, you know, like, just, kind of like going through and you just see all these people, like, kind of standing at each bar door, thinking, “Can I go in here?” And then the bars are so tiny, there\\'s what, like, I think six seats in this place? So, like, in addition to having a low ceiling, it\\'s like six seats, and we are right up against the bar. So I think that this is what\\'s really interesting. Golden Gai has this charm, yet Kabukicho has this kind of more like a sleazier reputation, right? So it\\'s almost like you\\'re in kind of a little bit of an island here. Tell us a little bit more about Kabukicho. Alex Martin 06:56 Right. So, I mean, I might have mentioned before, but the term, or the address, Kabukicho, it sort of conjures up a reputation of being sort of a sketchy area. So the neighborhood basically has everything you want. You got cinemas, you got, you know, old-school game centers, if you finish that kind of stuff. You got hostess bars and host clubs, and then Shinjuku Ni-chome, that\\'s the LGBTQ neighborhood, that\\'s really, you know, right next door. So, you know, there\\'s, you know, the famous photographer, Daido Moriyama-san, he once said, you know, he said that “Shinjuku is like a stadium of desire,” where people from all walks of life gather, so you basically can find everything you want here. And that\\'s why that\\'s the really strong appeal that the place has — although some people say it\\'s becoming gentrified, especially the station-front area, so we\\'ll see how that evolves in the decades to come. But so far, Golden Gai’s thriving. And as you can see, the night has just begun. Shaun McKenna 07:50 Well on today\\'s episode, we\\'re going to talk to some of those people that kind of make up this “stadium of desire.” So we\\'ll be right back after a quick break Moeka Iida is a staff writer for The Economist magazine. In May, she wrote a story titled “The controversial cult of the host club in Japan.” Moika, thanks for coming on Deep Dive. Moeka Iida 08:17 Thanks so much for having me. Shaun, I\\'m really excited to talk about the story. Shaun McKenna 08:22 Me too. You know, for those who don\\'t know what exactly is a host club? Moeka Iida 08:26 So host clubs are where hosts work, and hosts are male entertainers who serve female clients, and they\\'re part of Japan\\'s nighttime entertainment industry, and they exist in many parts of the country, but they\\'re concentrated in Kabukicho or Tokyo\\'s most famous red-light district. Shaun McKenna 08:43 And that\\'s a neighborhood that\\'s close to Shinjuku station. Moeka Iida 08:47 Yes, exactly. And basically, they\\'re the opposite of the more popular kabakura or “hostess clubs.” So basically, you have these young men who are usually attractive. They\\'re either good-looking or they\\'re good at talking, and you sit down with them and have a drink, and you, they also flirt with you, and the point for them is to offer psychological intimacy, so ... sex could happen between clients and the host, similar to how kabakura works. So you can exchange contacts with them. You\\'re free to meet them outside of the bars, but sex is officially not part of the bargain. Shaun McKenna 09:22 Right, OK. When did this kind of culture begin appearing in Japan? Moeka Iida 09:26 Host clubs became well-known in more recent years, say, around the 2000s but they have a pretty long history. So the first host club opened in the mid-1960s and I visited Ai Honten, which is the oldest host club that\\'s still around. It opened in 1971, and I went there, and I interviewed Hojo Yuichi, who is the owner of the club, and he\\'s been in the industry for 35 years. So he was very helpful for me to understand how the industry has transformed. And he told me that, in the early days, host clubs were mostly for rich women and usually married women or widows, and they came to enjoy ballroom dancing. So Ai Honten has a dance hall that, people don\\'t really use it these days, And he also mentioned that the early days hosts usually called themselves male geishas, so they often saw themselves as part of this lineage of Japanese traditional culture. And he was telling me how it\\'s not just the host clubs, but a lot of the businesses in the so called mizushobai, or Japan\\'s nighttime hospitality industry, they use a lot of terminology that was used in the Edo Period, Yoshiwara. Shaun McKenna 10:42 So that\\'s kind of like the red-light district in the Edo Period. Moeka Iida 10:49 In the Edo Period of the 1800s or when you had geishas and oidan, sure. So even today, kyabajo and hosts, when they don\\'t have enough customers, when they have a bad day for business, they use the term “ocha-piki” or making tea. Because when you don\\'t have enough customers, they kill time by making tea. And that was a term that geishas used in the Yoshiwara. So they keep using these kinds of, there is this kind of tradition that\\'s been passed on. Shaun McKenna 11:17 How did Hojo-san get into it? Moeka Iida 11:19 So back in the day, host clubs were seen as a very fringe, sleazy business. It was not in the mainstream. So Hojo-san, who entered the industry over 30 years ago, he told me that he joined a host club just because he was desperate for money. He dropped out of school, he was a bit of a rebel, he didn\\'t have any career options, and then someone invited him to work at a host club. So he did it just because he needed money, but he was very reluctant to join the business because he thought it might be dangerous, it\\'s kind of sleazy and shady, and he said that was how a lot of people joined the industry back in the day, but today, host clubs are totally different. Shaun McKenna 11:58 OK, so what does the modern host club look like? Moeka Iida 12:01 A lot of hosts have acquired celebrity status, they have a big social media following. You started seeing famous hosts on TV shows from around the 2000s and if you walk around Kabukicho today, you see all these billboards showing top-earning hosts, yeah. And you might have seen this billboard that says “shokugo ikemen”: “My job is to be handsome.” And that\\'s to promote host clubs, so they\\'re seen as celebrities. And also, I feel like the popularity of hosts recently has been helped by this oshikatsu culture. So “oshikatsu” has become a buzzword in Japan. It\\'s very trendy. It\\'s where mainly women, young women, they have a favorite J-pop idol or a K-pop idol or celebrity they like. I guess the English word for oshikatsu is “stanning,” like stanning for a favorite person. So I met a lot of women who said they used to spend a lot of money on concerts for J-pop idols or K-pop idols, but then they switch to host clubs because idols are someone you see on a stage, whereas hosts are close and you can access them more intimately. Shaun McKenna 13:14 Yeah. And what kind of men become hosts nowadays? Moeka Iida 13:17 I would say just ordinary men. So there\\'s a host I quote in my story, called Hiragi Saren. He works at a small host club, but he\\'s from Aomori Prefecture, so, a very rural area, and he said, just like a lot of girls in Japan want to become idols, he wanted to enter “a world that\\'s glamorous,” like he wanted to be a host and make his name and become famous. And a lot of people I spoke to, they also talk about how they have other aspirations, like they want to start a business, and they\\'re doing it to save enough money. And I also did meet some men who said they wanted to become a J-pop or K-pop idol, and they even went through training to become a K-pop idol, but they couldn\\'t make their way because it\\'s too competitive. So they\\'ve switched to host clubs instead, and they become, in a way, mini celebrities. And Hojo-san was actually saying something like, there\\'s this alliance between the women who like idols, but they want to interact with a handsome guy on a more intimate level, like an idol is someone is on a stage, but if you go to host club, you can drink with them and talk to them and even go on dates with them. And then there\\'s the men who wanted to become an idol, but couldn\\'t quite make it. And then they become mini celebrities and host clubs. So there\\'s kind of an alliance between those two parties. Shaun McKenna 14:32 Right, OK. So for your story, you went to one of these clubs. I haven\\'t been to a host club myself, but what was it like, the experience of going to a host club? Moeka Iida 14:42 Well, I was a bit nervous because I thought it might be a bit shady, or I might get ripped off, or maybe I like it too much, and I get addicted, or something. Shaun McKenna 14:49 The risks of the business. Moeka Iida 14:54 Yes, but I followed a friend who has been to a host club before, and I was a bit nervous, but we just walked around. Kabukicho and entered a building, and I was a bit like, “Oh, is it OK if I step in? Like, am I gonna get into trouble?” But, I mean, inside, it was a bit like a nightclub, like, it\\'s a bit, it\\'s pretty dark, and the decoration, I would say, is quite kitsch. Like, it\\'s almost bordering on tacky, like, you have all these, like chandeliers and these, like velvet, very luxurious sofas... Shaun McKenna 15:21 Kind of bubble-era... Moeka Iida 15:22 Exactly, exactly, very shiny diamonds and so on. And again, I was worried about getting ripped off, but I came to learn that they have this system called “shokai,” so a first-timer system, so the first time you go to a host club, it\\'s actually very cheap. You only pay around ¥1,000 to ¥3,000 again, and the idea is to get, like, a taste of who works there. Yeah, so it\\'s ¥1,000 to ¥3,000, it\\'s all-you-can-drink, so actually, it\\'s a bit it\\'s a really nice way to just hang out with friends and get a drink. And then all the different hosts in the club come to your table in turns, and they talk about five to 10 minutes, and then they leave, and they also give you their meishi, and sometimes it has a QR code for their Line account, or they ask you if you can exchange Lines with them. So it was kind of funny how, like, I\\'m constantly surrounded by several men, and they keep giving you their meishi, and by the end of the visit, I have like, 20 meishi or 30 meishi on my table, and it\\'s like a Pokemon card deck or something! Shaun McKenna 16:22 Just for people who don\\'t know, a meishi is like a business card in Japan, right? So on the first time you meet someone, especially in a formal situation, you would kind of present it and, yeah, come to know the person by the meishi. What kind of things did these guys talk to you about? Moeka Iida 16:39 They just make small talk. I mean, honestly, they ask really benign questions like, “Oh, what do you like to drink?” “How often do you come to Kabukicho” and something interesting about host clubs is they don\\'t ask questions like, “How old are you?” or, “What do you do for a living?” Because the idea is to create this fantasy world. A lot of the hosts I spoke to said, basically a host club is supposed to be like Disneyland. You know, Disneyland\\'s very popular among Japanese women. It\\'s about creating this fantasy world and an escape from your boring everyday life. So they basically just flatter you, they don\\'t ask questions that remind you of your daily life. And their job is to make you feel like a princess, like they make you feel like a princess. You\\'re needed, you\\'re desired, you\\'re beautiful, you\\'re hot, and so on. And actually, the host literally do call the clients a princess, like “hime.” Shaun McKenna 17:31 Right. OK, now I\\'m going to put you on the spot here. But were there any guys that you thought, you know, were kind of like clear winners at the end of the night? For you? Moeka Iida 17:39 Honestly, you know, I had pretty high expectations. I thought they\\'re going to be, like, really good-looking and super seductive and, like, great at talking. And honestly, I was surprised how a lot of these men seem like just ordinary guys. It\\'s quite telling about how a woman pays money to access just ordinary intimacy. It was quite interesting. But, you know, but sometimes you know, when you talk to them and they keep giving you compliments, and they say things like, “Oh, you\\'re so pretty,” like, “You\\'re my type,” and I\\'m like, you\\'re just trying to flatter me. But then a part of me is like, oh, maybe they actually mean it. Maybe they actually have a crush on me. Shaun McKenna 18:14 Yeah, it\\'s interesting, because you have to kind of like, allow yourself to kind of be seduced by the fantasy, right? Basically, in order for it to work. Moeka Iida 18:24 Yeah, exactly, right. Shaun McKenna 18:25 You know, I actually had a friend who went to a host club, maybe like 20 years ago, and she said they peeled her grapes for her. Did you see anything like that? Moeka Iida 18:33 That is so bizarre, I have not seen anything like that. But, you know, I feel like the old days host clubs were a bit more hard core, in a sense. So Hojo-san, who I spoke to, the guy who\\'s been in the industry for three decades, he said women, back in the day, they like, partied harder, and they like to drink a lot, and they were also a bit more aggressive. So he said, one time, this woman poured her drinks into her shoe, her high heels, and made him drink from it. Shaun McKenna 18:56 Oh, wow. OK, yeah, that is hard core. What is, what is the allure of a host club for Japanese women? Moeka Iida 19:02 You know, I think women go to host clubs for very different reasons. Some women go just because it\\'s fun, but I think it boils down to the fact that a lot of people are lonely. So there are a lot of women who go to host clubs on a very regular basis and you can see the hosts are a big part of their lives, almost like pseudo-boyfriends. Something I found interesting is if you look at the counterpart of a host club, so the kabakura or the hostess clubs — the male clients are free to pick different women each time they visit. But in a host club, it works very differently. They have a system called “eikyu shimei-sei,” like “permanent appointment.” So you pick one man, and you have to stick to that person. You have to become loyal to that person and work on your relationship with that person. And a lot of the women I spoke to, they\\'ve been seeing their host for very long periods, like even years, and they even go on dates together. They meet frequently outside of the bars and, they\\'ve even traveled together, and they also have all kinds of special memories, like the hosts keep track of anniversaries, like the first time they met, the first time she came to this bar, the first time they went traveling together, or they might even have matching items and so on. Like a boyfriend and girlfriend. Shaun McKenna 20:18 When you say they go traveling together, so are the women paying for the trips? Moeka Iida 20:23 That\\'s what I thought. But actually, in those cases, the host pays. It\\'s, in a sense, emulating an ordinary romantic relationship. If you\\'re meeting inside the bar, the woman pays as a client, but when you meet outside, it\\'s like hanging out with your boyfriend. The boy pays. And I think the rise of host clubs coincides with some demographic shifts as well. So in Japan, singledom is on the rise. So if you look at marriage statistics, more than 60% of Japanese women in their late 20s are unmarried today, and that\\'s double the rate in the mid-1980s and there was also a really surprising survey recently that showed a third of unmarried Japanese people in their 20s to 40s have never dated in their lives, right? That was really surprising for me, but I guess so. There\\'s a lot of single people these days, but it doesn\\'t necessarily mean that there\\'s no demand for companionship. There is still that need for romantic intimacy, and there is a business that is able to offer that. Shaun McKenna 21:28 Now, this whole kind of, like host club system isn\\'t without its faults, right? So you kind of talk in your article about problems like mounting debts, and you know, like, how women try to, like, pay for their host addictions — if we can call it addictions, it sounds kind of like it. And then it\\'s gotten to the point where even the government is kind of intervening. Moeka Iida 21:52 Exactly. I can see a lot of women for them, it has become a kind of addiction. It has become an unhealthy habit. And when I hear about their interactions with hosts, it almost seems like an abusive relationship. So one woman was talking about how her host would ask if she would like to open a bottle of Champagne, which is really expensive, and if she says no, he starts acting very cold, and he starts ignoring her, and starts fiddling with his phone so she would open that bottle of Champagne because she wants to get his attention. She doesn\\'t want him to get sad. And something interesting about host clubs, when you go in, it\\'s just one room and all the tables are in the same room. So as a customer, I can see all the other tables and all the other women sitting there. And sometimes your host, he has to leave and go talk to the other customers, and you can see them talking and sit next to each other and flirting, and I heard that is intentional. It\\'s a way to incite jealousy. So women start ordering more drinks or open bottles of Champagne so they want their host to come back to their table. Shaun McKenna 22:52 Right, there is a lot of psychology going on inside these host clubs. Moeka Iida 22:58 But jokes aside, there is a very serious issue of young women falling into debt and spending way more money than they can afford. And a way these young women can earn money is sex work, and they fall into working for prostitution. And there\\'s also been reports about women going abroad to do sex work. They use the word dekasegi, because if they go abroad, it\\'s easier to earn money, and because of the weak yen, it\\'s more lucrative to go abroad. And there\\'s even been reports about how the host clubs might be brokering this prostitution as well. So host clubs have come under a lot of criticism recently, both by the media and by politicians. And I spoke to Ayaka Shiomura, who\\'s a young female politician for the Constitutional Democratic Party, the liberal opposition to the LDP, and she\\'s been leading discussions about host clubs in Parliament. And I think the reason why they started paying attention to this has to do with Okubo Park. So Okubo Park is a park in Kabukicho. It\\'s very close to the Toyoko Square, but it\\'s become a popular pickup spot for prostitution. So if you go there, there\\'s a lot of young women standing there, and they\\'re waiting for someone to pick them up and sell sex. And there was a survey recently that showed 40% of the women who were arrested for selling sex around Okubo Park, they were doing it to go to host clubs. They weren\\'t doing it because they\\'re desperate for money. They were going, they were doing it to go to host clubs. And I find that really surprising as well. Yeah, that has, in a sense, created a moral panic, OK, but just to be clear, actually, um, this has been a tradition in Kabukicho for a very long time, even before legislators and the media started talking about it. So there has been a long tradition in Kabukicho where you have female sex workers or sex adjacent workers like kabajo and hostesses. They work all day. They deal with these clients, who are usually disgusting old men and then they, after work, they go and see their favorite host, who\\'s a pretty, young boy, and then they just vent out all their frustration. They basically spend all their money Shaun McKenna 25:08 Like a therapist. Moeka Iida 25:09 Exactly. It\\'s like therapy. And there\\'s actually a documentary. It\\'s an old documentary called “The Great Happiness Space” by Jake Clennell, and it\\'s a documentary about a host club in Osaka in the 2000s but it explores that idea, explores this idea of women in the sex industry going to host clubs to vent out their frustrations. Shaun McKenna 25:30 It\\'s interesting because, you know, Kabukicho, I think in recent years, has tried to clean up its image. Like, you now get there\\'s a big cinema, there a large game center, there\\'s like that hotel with the Godzilla attached to it. So they kind of are trying to make it more tourist-friendly. But like, for people who live here, there is still that kind of like reputation that it has that associates it with, kind of like, I don\\'t know, the shadier side of like, Japanese nightlife. Moeka Iida 26:02 Exactly, the area has gone through a lot of transformation. So there\\'s also the time during when Ishihara Shintaro was governor of Tokyo, he launched this initiative called kabukijo kasaksen, or a Kabukicho Cleansing Initiative, or something like that. And he tried to make the place a lot safer. And so the place has changed a lot. Shaun McKenna 26:22 Yeah, so is the government making progress with legislation, or is it just kind of in discussion stages? Moeka Iida 26:28 At the moment, I think it\\'s still in the discussion stages. I don\\'t feel like there\\'s been much progress in terms of introducing legislation, but Shiomura-san was talking about how they\\'re trying to handle manipulative business tactics in the host business by existing legislation. So there are laws pertaining to dating scams, or romance scams, as they call it. But it seems like the host club industry is trying to preempt this kind of official legislation by introducing self-governing rules. Shaun McKenna 26:56 OK? They\\'re trying to kind of regulate themselves before the government steps in. Moeka Iida 27:01 Exactly, right. So a very prevalent practice in the host club industry is called odekakin, but it\\'s basically like a pay-later system, so they keep tabs for customers, and what happens with that is people come and they spend way more money than they can afford, and then they fall into debt. So from April, supposedly, the host clubs have stopped practicing that. But I\\'m not really sure how much that has been enforced on the ground, and how effective these rules have been, but it seems like these kinds of discussions have brought a really big shift in the mindset in the industry. So when I talk to host club workers, they say they\\'re a lot more careful in terms of how they operate as a business. Shaun McKenna 27:41 Another thing I found interesting about your piece was that you kind of mentioned this broader implication for intimacy in Japan. Moeka Iida 27:50 Yes, exactly. So it\\'s not just host clubs. We talked about the kabakura and the hostesses, but there\\'s other kinds of businesses that offer intimacy in Japan, like the cuddle cafes, for instance. And on one hand, I find this culture very interesting. I think it\\'s a unique part of Japanese culture. It\\'s just really fascinating. But on the other hand, maybe there is something a bit worrying about how there\\'s so many people in this country who need to pay money to access this very ordinary, normal kind of intimacy, which people should be able to access in their everyday lives. And I was talking to Thomas Baudinette, who\\'s an anthropologist focused on Japanese popular culture, and he was raising the alarm about how intimacy in Japan seems to be increasingly commoditized. So a lot of people are in this dilemma, in this catch 22 where you want to keep seeing your host, you want to keep seeing the person you like, but in order to do that, you have to pay more and more money. And I feel like maybe there\\'s a link with broader social issues in Japan, like the high suicide rate, like loneliness is seen as a very big issue. It almost seems like people are living in their own little cells, and they\\'re just struggling to get by. They work really hard, they study really hard. They don\\'t really have the time or the capacity to build meaningful relationships outside of these tiny little cells. And there is a business that has commoditized that intimacy and can offer it to you as long as you pay money, and people will pay money to access that right? Shaun McKenna 29:18 Well, Moeka, it\\'s a very interesting story. And just to remind the listeners, it was for the Economist magazine. The title was “The controversial cult of the host club in Japan.” Thanks very much for coming on Deep Dive. Moeka Iida 29:31 This was so fun. Thank you so much for having me on. Shaun McKenna 29:42 On top of the tourist packed alleys of Golden Gai and the host clubs, Kabukicho has been in the news recently for another issue, the so- called Toyoko Kids. My colleague Yukana Inoue wrote about this hard-to-define group in an article titled “Toyoko Kids: The lonely street children of Tokyo.” Hi Yukana, what? Come back to Deep Dive. You\\'re talking to us from Osaka, yeah? Yukana Inoue 30:03 Yeah, hi. Thank you so much for having me again. And yeah, I\\'m in Osaka right now. Shaun McKenna 30:08 Well, thanks for making time. Let me ask you about this Toyoko Kids phenomenon you\\'ve written about. First of all, who are the Toyoko Kids? Yukana Inoue 30:16 So the Toyoko Kids have been in the news for the past several years. They\\'re called Toyoko Kids because they\\'re based “next to,” which is “yoko” in Japanese, to the Shinjuku Toho Building, which “to” is short for. So to-yoko is literally “next to” the Shinjuku “Toho” Building. But I\\'ve heard that the kids themselves don\\'t actually like being called Toyoko Kids. They call themselves “kaiwai-min,” which literally translates to “people in the community.” They\\'re sometimes described as street children of Tokyo, but they\\'re a mix of those who have permanently run away from home, but also those who kind of commute to Kabukicho and stay there for periods of time. But they are generally children or young adults in their teens to their early 20s, and they\\'re all kind of marginalized in one way or another, and kind of formed a unique young youth subculture in the area. They are kids who fall into drug use and general delinquency, kids who\\'ve kind of slipped through the cracks of society, either because of a poor home life, bad grades, behavioral issues, but nonetheless, they wind up living on the streets of Kabukicho. Shaun McKenna 31:22 Why Kabukicho? Why not Shibuya or Harajuku? Yukana Inoue 31:26 So next to the Toho building, there\\'s this big square, and it\\'s a prime location for kids to hang out in. And there are not that many spaces in congested cities like Shibuya or Ginza that allows for this kind of gathering. The fact that Kabukicho has a very robust sex and entertainment industry that\\'s regarded as the red-light district of Tokyo also plays a part in it. Since many of the kids partake in the industry in one way or another. Many of the girls, especially, are also lured to the area due to host clubs and underground idols, which also plays a factor. With that said, other places also have similar groups, like the “Guri-shita Kids” near the Glico sign in Osaka, as well as “Kego Kids” who are located in Kego Park in Fukouka. Also Kabukicho as an area has a long history of homelessness, where in the past, it used to be called Komageki-mae, and in the ’90s, even children as young as 4 or 5 years old would hang out there alone at night while their moms went to work in the nightlife establishments. Shaun McKenna 32:29 Yeah, I seem to recall that area being like a haven for homeless youth for a while, actually. Yukana Inoue 32:34 Yeah. So it\\'s not a new thing by any means. Um, youth homelessness, and just homelessness generally in the area, has been around for a while, but regarding that particular age group, it was made worse by the pandemic, because a lot of the kids had harsh home lives, and it was kind of exacerbated during the lockdown. For Toyoko Kids, there\\'s also a social media element to it, where the Toyoko Kids often post on TikTok or other social medias that somewhat romanticizes their lives on the street, and some kids even have titles like “God” or “Empress,” depending on the popularity and influence they have with the area, which is sometimes connected to their clout that they have on social media. And these social media posts also play a big role, because these posts are seen by young people in other parts of Japan, they will get in touch with the Toyoko Kids through means like DMs and such, and then they\\'ll run away and relocate to Kabukicho and come join the community. And they also pop up on a lot of tourists’ social media as well. It might be them chugging like Strong Zero, like very strong alcoholic drinks with these young people, and so they have also become kind of a tourist attraction themselves. Shaun McKenna 33:46 Right, so the social media aspect is kind of turning these kids into mini celebrities, in a way, Yukana Inoue 33:52 Yeah, I would say. So they definitely have a presence within the Tokyo community that tourists and domestic people alike are well aware of their existence. Shaun McKenna 34:02 Right. There seems to be, like, a big like trend element to this. Is it kind of, I don\\'t mean to, like belittle it, but like youth homelessness as a trend? Yukana Inoue 34:10 I would say there is definitely an aspect of it. And like I said before, not all of the kids are actually homeless. They are sometimes just short-term runaways. So it is, in a way, kind of like a trend. It is a youth subculture that they have created in the area within the past several years. And so them being out in Kabukicho isn\\'t really connected to the typical cause of homelessness. It\\'s just their way to escape reality and find a new sense of community in this part of Tokyo. But regardless of whether they\\'re homeless kids or just short term runaways, The problem arises when they get caught up in crime, drugs or other trouble in the area, many need to rely on things like street prostitution in order to support themselves once they\\'ve run away. So for the story, I spoke to Masanori Amano, who is the head of this organization called Nippon Kakekomidera, and it\\'s a volunteer organization in the Kabukicho area that offers support to Toyoko Kids. And he was telling me that he encountered a girl as young as 10 who was involved in street prostitution at Kabukicho. And I also heard that, on average, many of the girls make around ¥1 million to ¥2 million a month from street prostitution, which is kind of crazy. Shaun McKenna 35:25 Wow, yeah, that\\'s really awful. The youth element, that seems really serious, and these stories must have alerted the authorities in some way. ... Actually, on that, can the police not do a sweep or something to get minors off the street? Yukana Inoue 35:38 So actually, unless they\\'re caught breaking the law like drugs or underage drinking or prostitution, the police can\\'t really do much about it. If runaways aren\\'t reported missing by their parents, they can\\'t be taken off the streets just for being there. This is why the group of kids just standing around in Kabukicho continues to persist. There is a curfew for minors in Japan from 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. but it has to be enforced by the parents, and so the parents are the ones penalized for it if it\\'s not followed. And so the lack of parenting in this situation makes enforcing the curfew sort of a gray area for the police. That said the police have one legal tool called “hodou,” or protective custody, where they can detain minors for breaking curfew. And in fact, 21 minors were quote, unquote, “arrested” just this past Tuesday in Kabukicho under this protective custody. Shaun McKenna 36:30 I see. So you mentioned the group, Nippon Kakekomidera, supporting these kids. What does that support look like? What do they do? Yukana Inoue 36:37 So the organization is based in Kabukicho, and they offer a helping hand to anyone in the area, including the Toyoko Kids. As part of it, they hold this event called Kabukicho Mirai Cafe every Saturday where they provide hot food like omurice or curry or anything like that, every Saturday to anyone who shows up. They\\'ve been doing it since August of 2022 and I heard that on average, they get around 30 to 50 people every Saturday. When I went last January, I saw quite a lot of them cycle in and out as well. So through these like weekly events, the staff tries to engage with the children so that they feel more comfortable coming into the organization\\'s office any other day to talk about their problems. And at this organization, the staff kind of acts like an older sibling to the children, and instead of, like, scolding them, they lended a helping, they lend an ear, and they wait for the young people to realize on their own that they\\'re not in a good place. Since a lot of the time, the children just need someone to talk to. And once they begin opening up, they offer guidance to support them in any ways that they can. Like, for example, I heard a story from Amano about a girl who was addicted to drugs, and she expressed an interest to him that she wanted to play the piano, but she never had the chance to do so growing up. And so Amano promised her that he would buy a piano for the office, and she could come into play, as long as she gave up drugs, and she did, and because she was an influential figure within the community, a lot of the younger girls looked up to her also followed her steps and quit drugs, which kind of sounds like a fairy tale story. Amano was also telling me that there were some kids coming to him, saying that they wanted to go to college, but they were scared that it was too late for them, to which he helped by inviting several students from Tokyo University to come volunteer and tutor them, right? So yeah, this is just in a couple examples of the sort of thing that the organization does. Shaun McKenna 38:36 So how\\'s Amano\\'s organization doing now? Yukana Inoue 38:39 Yeah, so they\\'re continuing, and they have also joined onto a project by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government that was set up to provide additional sources and support to the Toyoko Kids. They set up a two-week counseling pop up in January in the Kabukicho area, which offered Wi-Fi chargers, snacks and counseling to those who needed it, and it became a permanent fixture starting in April. Shaun McKenna 39:04 OK, that\\'s good. Well, we talked earlier about this idea of the Toyoko Kids being a trend. And again, that\\'s not to make light of the situation, but trends usually come to an end, right? So could this problem perhaps solve itself? Yukana Inoue 39:18 Yeah. I mean, there are signs that it is kind of being resolved, and the community appears to be getting smaller compared to how big it was at the peak of it, and there has been more efforts, like I mentioned, by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and organizations like Nippon Kakekomidera around the country that has helped, and because of the more strict crackdowns by The police, it has discouraged the kids from staying there. But at the same time, the important thing here is that while the Toyoko Kids are somewhat of a trend and partly a social media phenomenon, actual youth homelessness as well as the problems in the homes that prompt these kids to run away in the first place, these are issues that need constant attention, and more needs to be done to help that they\\'re not going to go away anytime soon. So those are the issues that need to be more focused on. Shaun McKenna 40:08 Well, Yukana, thanks for joining us on Deep Dive. Yukana Inoue 40:11 Thank you, thank you for having me again. Shaun McKenna 40:21 So we\\'re back at Golden Gai, my thanks to Alex and Yukana and Moeka and, of course, the staff at Hip for kind of hosting us in this portion of the show. We here at Deep Dive had gone bi-weekly for a bit, and have some sad news, our producer, Dave Cortez, is going to be moving on to a new job, Dave, would you like to say something? Dave Cortez 40:46 Yeah, I would. I\\'m definitely sad to be going. I have to say I had a great time making this podcast with you, Shaun, and with you, obviously, Alex, week after week, I got the chance to see Japan a lot and to bring people stories that were really interesting. And I\\'m happy that you guys tuned in to listen to what we made. Shaun McKenna 41:00 Well, we\\'re gonna miss you, Dave, and that also means that we will be going on a bit of a break while we hunt for a new engineer and producer. So, on that note, our music that you\\'ve been hearing on the show has been by LLLL and Oscar Boyd. I\\'ve been Shaun McKenna, and we\\'ve got a couple drinks ... to Dave, a much deserved podtsukare! Have a good summer, everyone.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'Jul 17, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday cut Japan\\'s economic growth forecast for this year due, citing temporary auto output disruptions and weak private investment in the first quarter. But the fund offered an optimistic view on consumption due to prospects that the bumper pay hikes offered by firms in this year\\'s shuntо̄ spring wage negotiations will lift household incomes.  \"In Japan, the strong shuntо̄ wage settlement is expected to support a turnaround in private consumption starting in the second half,\" the IMF said in an update to its World Economic Outlook report. The IMF said it now expects Japan\\'s economy to expand 0.7% this year, down 0.2 percentage point from its forecast in April, after an 1.9% increase in 2023. It maintained its projection for the economy to grow 1.0% in 2025. Recent weakness in consumption has been cited by some analysts as a factor that could discourage the Bank of Japan (BOJ) from raising interest rates too soon from the current near-zero levels. BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda has voiced optimism over the outlook for consumption, saying it will likely rebound once wage hikes broaden and boost households\\' purchasing power. The BOJ will likely trim this year\\'s economic growth forecast in July but project inflation will stay around its 2% target in the next few years, sources have said, keeping alive the chance of an interest rate hike this month. Japan\\'s economy shrank an annualized 2.9% in January-March due to output disruptions among some automakers and soft consumption blamed in part on rising inflation. Many analysts expect growth to have rebounded in the April-June quarter as auto output disruptions run their course.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Nearly 90% of Japanese households expect prices to rise a year from now, a quarterly central bank survey showed on Friday, a sign of heightening inflation expectations that would help make the case for a near-term interest rate hike. But households were more pessimistic about current economic conditions compared with three months before, boding ill for the outlook of consumption.  Of the total households surveyed by the Bank of Japan, 87.5% said they expect prices to rise a year from now, up from 83.3% in a previous survey in March. The survey also showed 82.0% of the respondents expect prices to rise five years from now, higher than 80.6% in the previous survey. Households' perception about future inflation is among key factors the BOJ scrutinizes in deciding when to raise interest rates, as well as the outlook for consumption and wages. An index gauging the ratio of households who are optimistic about the economy versus those who are pessimistic stood at minus 49.8 in June, worse than minus 36.1 in March, the survey showed. The BOJ ended negative interest rates and other remnants of its radical stimulus in March. Gov. Kazuo Ueda has said the central bank will raise interest rates further if it becomes more convinced that inflation will durably hit its 2% target.\"},\n",

The figures indicate that Japan’s currency authorities tried to take advantage of a buildup of expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut immediately after data showed U.S. inflation cooling broadly. The suspected intervention on Thursday would be the first aimed at boosting the yen when it was strengthening against the dollar, a fresh development in Japan’s strategy of trying to keep speculators on the back foot since it started propping up the yen in September 2022. Some market watchers had already been alert to the possibility of intervention if U.S. prices proved hotter than expected, which could have prompted a yen slump. The likelihood of Tokyo stepping in if the yen started strengthening had not been widely anticipated. \"The timing of intervention was unexpected,” said Shinichiro Kobayashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research & Consulting. \"They wanted to show they have many ways to intervene as this battle drags on without any clear sign of light at the end of the tunnel.” Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki and top currency chief Masato Kanda both declined to comment Friday on whether they intervened in line with their responses following action earlier this year around the end of April. Local media reported that the authorities had stepped into the market citing unidentified officials. The speculation of intervention surged after abrupt moves in the yen overnight. In little more than 30 minutes after weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation data came out Thursday night in Tokyo, the currency strengthened sharply from around ¥161.58 against the dollar to ¥157.44, a move of just over ¥4, on a similar scale to most of the previous interventions. The yen was trading at around ¥159.09 against the dollar as of Friday evening in Tokyo. It has shed more than 11% this year, making it the biggest loser among major currencies. The estimated size of the intervention is based on movements in the central bank’s accounts. The BOJ reported Friday that its current account will probably fall ¥3.2 trillion due to government fiscal factors on the next business day of Tuesday. That compares with an average forecast increase of ¥333 billion among private money brokers prior to the suspected intervention, including Central Tanshi, Totan Research and Ueda Yagi Tanshi. \"It looks highly likely they jumped on the strengthening of the yen and weakening of the dollar after the U.S. CPI result to intervene and were able to boost the yen with less than the ¥4 trillion or so they spent last time in May,” said Yuichiro Takai, an analyst at Totan Research. Comparing money broker estimates with the BOJ’s current account projection has proved accurate in calculating a ballpark figure for past interventions since September 2022. In further evidence of intervention, Thursday was one of the busiest days for Japanese yen spot trading since November 2016, according to CME Group, the world’s largest regulated currency market. Some $53 billion was traded in the dollar-yen pair on CME’s spot EBS platform, the fourth highest since Jan. 1, 2022, a representative for the exchange said in an emailed response to questions. Earlier this year, the government spent a record ¥9.8 trillion in interventions around the end of April and the beginning of May to support the yen after it fell to a 34-year low against the dollar. Bloomberg calculations had estimated the scale of yen buying at ¥9.4 trillion. Official monthly intervention data is due on July 31, when Kanda is scheduled to step down as part of a regular bureaucratic reshuffle, to be replaced by Atsushi Mimura, who is currently director general of the Finance Ministry’s international bureau. Japan’s government has struggled to shift the tide in the foreign exchange market. Inflation has stayed elevated at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for more than two years, with the yen being a key driver. As real wages fall, consumer spending has dropped every quarter for a year though March. One of the main factors driving the weakness in the yen is the difference in interest rates between the U.S. and Japan, especially the differential between yields on long-term debt after accounting for inflation. That suggests that a rate hike by the BOJ or a rate cut by the Fed would help lift the yen. Japan’s central bank has repeatedly said it does not target the yen and has shown resistance to overtly changing policy to support the currency. But Gov. Kazuo Ueda has said that policy could be changed if the weak yen was seen changing the outlook for inflation. There’s no unanimous view on the impact of the likely intervention on the BOJ’s policy decision on July 31. Some economists say the action in the markets made a rate hike more likely because following a government response, the central bank needed to act next. Others say it made it a rate hike more unlikely because pressure on the yen has eased. \"The BOJ won’t move on rates in July,” said Nobuyasu Atago, chief economist at Rakuten Securities Economic Research Institute, citing the continued sluggishness of consumer spending and the overall economy. \"If they move now, they will be seen as reacting to the yen.” \"The BOJ is still haunted by its past mistakes of being forced to cut rates shortly after hiking,” former BOJ official Atago said.'},\n",

There were 4,887 bankruptcies between January and June, up 22% from the same period a year ago, according to corporate credit research firm Teikoku Databank.  The debt of bankruptcies between January and June totaled roughly ¥681.02 billion ($4.24 billion), down 25% from a year ago, largely of small and midsized companies, the research firm said in a report. \"With the rapid depreciation of the yen and lackluster consumer spending, the business environment surrounding small and midsized enterprises remained severe in the second half of the year,\" it said. The number of bankruptcies could surpass 10,000 by the end of the year, it added. The service industry saw the number of entities going out of business exceeding 1,200 for the first time in 15 years, according to the report. In the retail sector, the number of restaurants going under hit the highest level since 2000. The Bank of Japan in March ended eight years of negative interest rates and its bond yield control in a historical shift away from its prolonged radical stimulus program. The central bank debated the chance of a near-time interest rate hike at the June policy meeting, raising speculation that heightening inflationary pressure could prod it to debate raising the rates at this month\\'s meeting.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Goldman Sachs Group has hired former Bank of Japan chief economist Akira Otani, bolstering its research team as global investors pay increasing attention to the Asian country and its exit from years of monetary stimulus. Otani has joined the Wall Street bank’s securities arm in Tokyo as senior Japan economic adviser and managing director, according to a statement Tuesday. His hiring came months after the company’s former chief Japan economist Naohiko Baba joined Barclays.  Japan has come under the international spotlight as it gets closer to overcoming decades of deflation while accelerating overhauls to bolster corporate profit. Economists are debating when the central bank will next raise interest rates, after scrapping its negative-rate policy in March. Otani has more than 30 years of experience as an economist and holds a master’s degree in economics from the University of Rochester. Otani had most recently served as the BOJ’s chief economist as well as director-general of its Research and Statistics Department. He headed the Financial Markets Department before that, overseeing bond purchases and other market operations. \"Otani-san’s extensive experience and deep insight into the Japanese economy will be an invaluable resource for our clients at a time when global investors are focused on the BOJ and its path towards monetary policy normalization,” Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs’s chief economist and head of global investment research, said in the release. Goldman Sachs led major investment banks posting higher profits in the country last year as bond trading boomed, offering a cushion in an otherwise tough environment globally. Net income at Goldman Sachs Japan rose to ¥39.2 billion ($244 million), the highest in 14 years, according to its annual filing.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Japan’s economy showed scant signs of a clear recovery with its narrower-than-first-estimated contraction leaving plenty of reason for continued caution among policymakers as the Bank of Japan eyes the timing of its next interest rate hike. Gross domestic product (GDP) shrank at an annualized pace of 1.8% in the three months through March, the Cabinet Office said Monday, compared with a 2% retreat reported in preliminary data. Economists had forecast the updated figures would be unchanged.  The data showed both consumers and companies cutting back on spending and unsold supplies building up on warehouse shelves as the strongest inflation trend in decades continues to crimp outlays in real terms. \"The data confirmed weakness in consumption. A breakdown shows spending on durable goods was weak, which I think reflected the impact of the Daihatsu (certification irregularities) problem on auto purchases,” said Toru Suehiro, economist at Daiwa Securities. \"The BOJ doesn’t have a choice but to be cautious about the economy.” Personal consumption data were left unchanged at minus 0.7%, marking a fourth quarter of declines, while business spending figures were revised to minus 0.4% from a preliminary decline of 0.8%. Inventories added 0.3 percentage point to growth, while net exports were tweaked to reflect a slightly larger drag on the economy. Weak consumption is a source of concern for the government and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) as authorities seek indications that demand can withstand persistent inflation. Economists expect the central bank to hold its benchmark policy rate steady at a two-day meeting concluding on Friday, with many predicting a hike by October. A rebound in growth in the current quarter is widely expected as the economy recovers from the effects of one-off factors including a New Year’s Day earthquake on the Noto Peninsula. An auto production halt due to a certification scandal also weighed on growth in the period. While that output has since been restored, a fresh revelation may exert a drag in the current quarter. Strong second-quarter GDP data, initially due in August, would be a positive development for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who will have to prevail in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s next leadership contest in September to stay in power. Among risks to the outlook, households are set to see a rise in utility costs as the government phases out subsidies. Meanwhile, workers have seen declines in real wages for more than two years, while retirees on fixed income have been hit even harder as they cope with inflation at or above the BOJ’s 2% target. Higher costs for imports due to the yen’s slump may further lift food and energy prices. Many households will get some help in the form of one-off tax rebates starting in June. While Kishida hopes the measure will help eradicate the nation’s deflationary mindset, economists have been lukewarm in assessing the likely impact of the steps. Still, analysts expect real wages adjusted for inflation to turn positive in coming months after annual wage talks resulted in pledges by large companies to lift pay by more than 5%. The weak yen also has some positive effects for the economy, boosting corporate earnings abroad and inbound tourism. The fragile economic picture complicates the path of policymaking. The BOJ is likely to discuss the reduction of its government bond purchases as early as this week, as it continues to normalize its policy following its historic interest rate hike in March, according to people familiar with the matter. \"It’s difficult for the BOJ to raise interest rates significantly, given the current weakness of domestic demand,” said Shumpei Goto, researcher at the Japan Research Institute. \"On the other hand, the weak yen has pushed up prices of food and nondurable goods, which in turn has reduced consumer spending, so there is a possibility the BOJ will slightly alter its course” through tweaking bond purchase plans or other means. \"Capital spending was revised upward, but the figure was still negative, suggesting wobbly business confidence,\" said Taro Kimura, economist at Bloomberg Economics. \"Private consumption dropping for a fourth straight quarter shows the cost-of-living crunch is keeping households cautious about spending.” As the outcry over the weak yen mounts among businesses, Japan has spent a record ¥9.8 trillion ($62.8 billion) to prop up the yen this year. The BOJ currently expects cost-push inflation to continue to ease and transition into demand-driven price gains. Gov. Kazuo Ueda said the central bank will consider taking action if foreign exchange moves have a big impact on the inflation trend.'},\n",

Shaun McKenna 0:09 Welcome to Deep Dive from The Japan Times, I'm Shaun McKenna. You know, I've been seeing a lot of old friends from home recently, and they're among the hordes of tourists who've been taking advantage of the cheaper yen and post-pandemic wanderlust. And tourists have been everywhere in the news. monthly visitors in March exceeded 3 million for the first time ever, a number that held strong in April, and not everyone has been behaving in a way the locals appreciate. So, starting in April, tourists were banned from private alleys in Kyoto's Gion district, giving the geisha a little respite from these budding paparazzi, and, of course, a town in Yamanashi built a 2½-meter-high, 20-meter-long mesh net to block the view of Mount Fuji at a prime photo spot the tourists were clogging up. Long lines, crowds of selfie sticks, tourist bans — for people coming here for the first time, as well as longer-term residents, there's this question: Has Japan become like Venice or Paris, an ossified Disneyland in which people are resigned to copy-paste an itinerary? In short, is it still possible to have an original travel experience in Japan? After five years of living in Japan, today's guest still thinks it's possible — but you've got to be willing to sweat a little. On this week's episode, I'm talking to culture writer Thu-Huong Ha about her feature from April, “Why is the most exciting art in Japan so hard to get to?” She reported on a unique movement of art in Japan that encourages sweaty, inconvenient travel, a movement that challenges assumptions of how people ought to consume art and culture. Hi Thu, welcome back to Deep Dive. Thu-Huong Ha 01:50 Happy to be here. Shaun McKenna 01:52 So, today we're talking about what you've dubbed Japan's inconvenient art movement. You detailed this in an article for The Japan Times in April, and if I can just read a section of what you wrote: “To complete one of the original pilgrimages of the contemporary art world, you must eschew Japan's august convenience completely. You must be willing to sweat, to arrive early, to stand in a queue, to trawl PDFs on your phone, to wander abandoned villages looking for signage, to run and catch the ferry or bus, to beg forgiveness of a white-gloved attendant for any number of rule violations.” Japan, in my experience, I’d describe it as a place of great convenience. So what are you finding inconvenient, what exactly is inconvenient art? Thu-Huong Ha 02:36 Japan has this unique thing where a lot of public money goes into putting really, really great art in places that are really, really hard to get to. Shaun McKenna 02:43 So we're not talking like getting to Ueno by the Yamanote Line during rush hour, right? Thu-Huong Ha 02:47 No, no. Shaun McKenna 02:48 It's more like the, what, the giant polka-dotted pumpkin out west? Thu-Huong Ha 02:52 Exactly, so I think listeners would probably recognize Yayoi Kusama’s yellow pumpkin in Naoshima, which is this big yellow sculpture with black spots, and in the background is this blue sea. Shaun McKenna 03:03 Yeah, I've never been. Thu-Huong Ha 03:04 Shaun, you've lived in Japan for 23 years and you've never been to Naoshima? Shaun McKenna 03:07 It’s on my to-do list for this year. Back off. Thu-Huong Ha 03:11 It's time. Yeah, I mean it is very far and I think that is part of the appeal for me. These inconvenient art sites and events and works are usually placed far from any major city, far from any shinkansen station. You need a lot of patience, you need a lot of logistics. It's definitely not cheap. It's definitely time-consuming. Shaun McKenna 03:33 Well, let's talk about that distance for a minute. So I think from my house, I think I'd need to catch a train to either an airport or shinkansen station, fly to what, Osaka or Okayama, and then I'd need to catch a ferry, right? So, I want to vacation. I don't want around Japan in 80 days. But, you know, Deep Dive producer Dave Cortez, didn't you visit Naoshima? Dave Cortez 03:56 Yeah, I did a few years ago. I really enjoyed the art. But it was August in 2021, and in my nearly 10 years in Japan, I have never experienced such a hot day. I was actually kind of baffled, like, really? Naoshima is the hottest place on the planet right now? But yeah, I did get a selfie with the pumpkin. Thu-Huong Ha 04:17 And then that pumpkin blew away famously. Dave Cortez 04:20 Yeah, I was actually there the day before that happened. So this really hot day with not a cloud in the sky. But then the next day this huge typhoon rolls in and washes the pumpkin away and I see it on the news just floating. Thu-Huong Ha 04:31 Yeah, imagine going all the way to Naoshima and there's no pumpkin. I think that's part of the risk of these, like, inconvenient art spots. They take a lot of logistics. And then once you're there, it's just like, “Yeah, weather.” Shaun McKenna 04:44 Yeah, in your article, though, you make this seem like a feature. So it's kind of like the idea that, not to sound corny, but like the cherry blossoms, right? These are objects of beauty that are only here for a limited time. Is it part of the appeal that the artworks could disappear at any minute? Thu-Huong Ha 05:00 I mean, the inconvenience is definitely by design. I think the artists and the organizers know that they're taking a risk. They're putting these public works just out there in the elements. But I don't know if they're psyched about the fragility, like it's very romantic to think of it that way. But I think you know, these are publicly, partly publicly funded works and projects, and I can see how that can become hard to justify. Shaun McKenna 05:21 So you might be thinking of Oku-Noto, right? Thu-Huong Ha 05:25 Right. So last year, last fall, I went to Oku-Noto Triennale, which is very inconvenient, it's at the tip of the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture. There's only two flights a day from Tokyo, and then you've got to drive or you're like, totally stranded. And on Jan. 1 of this year, it was hit by a pretty bad earthquake. Shaun McKenna 05:43 Yeah, so you're referring to the earthquake that hit New Year's Day. It was a magnitude 7.6, and as of last month there were 245 people who had died and maybe three still missing, but thousands displaced from their homes and without permanent housing. Thu-Huong Ha 05:59 Yeah, that's right. And about half of the works from that festival sustained damage. Shaun McKenna 06:02 That actually reminds me of something in your story, and it had to do with the salt tower. Do you want to tell that story? Thu-Huong Ha 06:08 Sure. Yeah, so “A Path of Memories,” which is a work by Mottoi Yamamoto. It's this big salt tower structure, it's actually inside and, as many of these works are, it's in an abandoned school. And it's in this bright blue room and the salts is just like pure white Ishikawa salt. It looks like a crumbling brick wall and it's, on the bottom, the salt is meticulously combed, like a Zen garden. It took volunteers 50 days or five months to complete and an already survived a big earthquake in May of 2023. And when I was there in the fall of 2023, I saw a toddler, like almost, end that artwork. She was barreling right for it, she was about to just, like, jump right in there and she was screaming, “I want to touch it!” But then one of her adults caught her in time. Shaun McKenna 07:02 But the salt tower didn't survive the January quake. Thu-Huong Ha 07:05 No, it survived the toddler but it did not survive the earthquake, and it's been completely toppled. But I did see on social media that Yamamoto said that maybe he can restore the tower. Shaun McKenna 07:15 So if I were to make a checklist of what constitutes inconvenient art, I could probably add inaccessibility and maybe a kind of fragility, and that public funding aspect, at least in terms of what Japan is doing? Thu-Huong Ha 07:28 Yeah, I think so. Shaun McKenna 07:29 So what sparked your interest in this style of displaying art? Thu-Huong Ha 07:32 The first time I came to Japan was actually a decade ago next week, I went to Naoshima on that trip, and I went to Teshima, which is another inconvenient art spot, it's the neighboring island to Naoshima. And back then, I mean, I wasn't living in Japan but I really, like, nobody I knew had heard of these places. Like maybe one or two people. Shaun McKenna 07:52 Did you know much about Japan at the time? Thu-Huong Ha 07:53 I didn't it was my, you know, it was my first time I was just a, you know, trip with my parents. I was in my 20s, I wasn't really doing what I wanted in my career, I actually got unexpectedly dumped the night before I left for my trip. I was very frayed on this trip — not a lot of sleep and a lot of emotions. But I think I, you know, I didn't realize at the time, but I think Teshima really profoundly affected my life and, like, kind of, in a very, very indirect way set me on a trajectory that like, kind of oriented me for maybe where I'm sitting right now. It also kind of more concretely got me interested in pursuing these kinds of remote art destination type of places. So I think I've probably since then, I've traveled some, like 10,000 miles in the U.S. and in Japan to see these kinds of, you know, hard-to-access works. I've missed many boats. I've gotten speeding tickets. I got caught in this, like, really intense apocalyptic lightning storm, I've sweat a lot, I've lost a lot of money because of logistical mistakes. Shaun McKenna 08:56 I think we've all been there, actually, except I don't have anything to show for it, I haven’t even been to Naoshima. But I guess for you, I mean, like that initial pilgrimage, it seems to have had some kind of impact. Thu-Huong Ha 09:06 Yeah, I think it definitely taught me a different way of traveling. [music break] Shaun McKenna 09:19 So we've been talking about the inconvenient pilgrimage to the far reaches of Japan to see this kind of art. Is this kind of experience unique to Japan? Like, do other countries have art that's hard to get to? Thu-Huong Ha 09:30 Yeah, for sure they do. I think a prominent example is land art, which is a conceptual art movement from the 1960s and 70s. In the U.S., an especially prominent example is “Spiral Jetty” by Robert Smithson. These are works that are built directly into the Earth, and are often in hard-to-reach places because that's where there's space to build them. But it wasn't always the point to actually go and see them. So part of the concept would be to record the works being made and then being eroded in photos and video. And those would be, like, shown in a gallery in New York, for example. But, you know, with these, the point is going is definitely part of it. In Japan, I think these inconvenient art places are, you know, to use a very journalistic term “more of a thing.” They're more mainstream, you see kids at them. And then there's this element of, you know, integration with the public citizenry. Shaun McKenna 10:23 Well, tell us a little bit more about how this thing came about, like where did it all begin? Thu-Huong Ha 10:27 So it really did start in Naoshima, actually. So now, Naoshima has this robust tourism industry. But from the early 1900s, it was actually a place for a large-scale copper refinery, and that was the dominant industry there. And that was on the island's north side. In 1955, during Japan's post-war baby boom, the population of the island peaked at 7,500 — that's more than double what it is today. And by the 1960s, half of the working population of Naoshima was in manufacturing. But you know, pollution became, like, a pretty big problem, and agriculture was also a big problem here. Agriculture is, I think, still difficult to sustain on the north side of the island. The groundwater has this really intense sulfuric smell. Shaun McKenna 11:12 Wow, Naoshima sounds like it was in rough shape. Thu-Huong Ha 11:15 Yeah, and there was a mayor who played like an outsize importance in Naoshima’s history. Chikatsugu Miyake really wanted to change the image of Naoshima and he served from 1959 to 1995. Shaun McKenna 11:29 Wow, what a term. Thu-Huong Ha 11:30 He was also the priest of the main shrine. Shaun McKenna 11:33 Renaissance man. Thu-Huong Ha 11:36 So in 1985, he met Tetsuhiko Fukutake, who was the founder of Fukutake Publishing, which today is the billion-dollar corporation Benesse Holdings. They met on the south side of the island, so like not the factory side. And they talked about building a cultural center for kids. After Fukutake died unexpectedly, his son, Soichiro, came back to Okayama to take over the business. And then in 1988, Soichiro met Tadao Ando. Shaun McKenna 12:05 Right, so Tadao Ando is a celebrated, Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architect and, in Tokyo you might know his work, he did the revamped Shibuya Station — at least the subway part of it — Omotesando Hills ... but he's designed a lot of museums across the country, right, like, including the Tokyo Art Museum. Thu-Huong Ha 12:23 Right, that Tadao Ando. At that time he was only 47, he was still seven years away from winning the Pritzker. And these two guys got together, they weren't even sure they were going to work together. They met at an izakaya (Japanese pub) and then, yeah, kind of, the rest is history. Now Naoshima is covered in what's very recognizable Tadao Ando architecture. Shaun McKenna 12:44 You know, some of the most productive conversations happen at Japanese izakaya. Thu-Huong Ha 12:48 You don't have to tell me. So just backing up a little bit, they completed this arts camp in 1989, Naoshima International Camp, and Fukutake was getting more interested in art. In 1988, he went to this big Monet show in Boston, and he saw a “Water Lilies” painting, 2x6 meters. And he writes in his book, “Naoshima Setouchi Āto no Rakuen,” or “Naoshima Setouchi Art Paradise,” he said that the painting called to him, it said, “Buy me. Keep me near you.” And so, you know, he did what any other billionaire-to-be would do: He bought the Monet. And in 2004, he opened Chichu Art Museum, which is an underground building, also designed by Ando. It has just a few permanent works, which includes the “Water Lilies,” and installations by American artists James Terrell and Walter de Maria. And I think that museum, the Chichu Museum, is really what set Naoshima on its, on its course for now. Tourism to Naoshima had been kind of steady, and then, after the opening of the museum, numbers jumped, they nearly doubled in the Chichu’s first year, and then they doubled again by 2007. Shaun McKenna 13:59 So, can we say that these three men, Chikatsugu Miyake, Soichiro Fukutake and Tadao Ando, were they kind of like the fathers of inconvenient art? Thu-Huong Ha 14:09 So there's actually one more key player who wasn't like there yet? His name is Fram Kitagawa. Shaun McKenna 14:16 Right, OK, tell us more about what he did. Thu-Huong Ha 14:19 So Kitagawa was really different from these other guys. His name Fram, Furamu, is very unusual, you know, that's his actual name his father gave it to him, it's Norwegian for “progress.” And his father was an expelled member of the Communist Party, Kitagawa is pretty left, like, he organized this traveling art exhibition that was an anti-apartheid themed event, that went all around Japan in the 1980s. In 2000, he organized the first Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale, which was an art festival with site-specific works by pretty big names — Terrell, like I said, Marina Abromowich. People could actually stay overnight in these artworks. I stayed in one and came on this podcast to talk about it where I had to sleep in a coffin. The festival was designed really as a revitalization project, so has a couple of goals. One is to instill pride in the local citizens to make them, you know, proud again of where they live, to bring in outside tourism, obviously, to boost the local economy. And to some extent, I think they're hoping that young people will want to relocate to these rapidly depopulating regions. Shaun McKenna 15:27 How was the reaction from the art world? Did the art world really liked it? Thu-Huong Ha 15:32 No, it was not a hit. I mean, I think the first one, barely anyone came maybe. Like, once a day someone would show up to see at work. There are a lot of complaints about humidity, about signage. Shaun McKenna 15:44 So you went in 2022, and it kind of sounded like the same issues sort of still exist, right? Like, we spoke to you, as you mentioned, about the trip here on the podcast. Actually, that was almost a year ago. Thu-Huong Ha 15:55 Yeah, it was hot man. And even by then, it was its eighth edition and it was super, super hard to navigate. Like, Niigata has these intensely humid summers. In the winter, it can get up to 9 meters of snow. The artworks are like half in the wild. We had paper maps, we were using their app, we had our own GPS and was still really hard to navigate. Just kind of ended up driving through like some overgrown brush and just being like, “Is that art? I can't tell. I think I see art!” Then yeah, then you stop the car and look for a sign to check if it's art or not. We're used to seeing art in a very different way. Obviously, like, art isn't usually hearty. It needs air conditioning and conservation. And so you know, that's what we're used to seeing in an art museum or in a gallery. But that was actually the point. Kitagawa didn't want this typical art experience, he saw it as he writes in his book, “Hiraku Bijutsu” or “Open Art,” he saw “the charm of inefficient and sweaty art exhibitions.” Shaun McKenna 17:00 Yeah, you must suffer for your art. But I don't know if I should suffer. But, how do we connect Fram Kitagawa to this giant yellow polka-dot pumpkin in Naoshima. Thu-Huong Ha 17:09 Eventually, Echigo-Tsumari did win people over. It took, I think, a couple of additions to get going. And I think people start to appreciate like, the remoteness and the stress and they start to think of it maybe as a bit more like a pilgrimage. And it was successful enough that it started to kind of become Kitagawa’s signature model. And people, like local governments, from around the country were calling him up and being like, “Hey, can you come do it in our place?” And in 2006, after the third Echigo-Tsumari, Kitagawa got a call from none other than Soichiro Fukutake of Benesse. He said, “Come and work on a festival based in Naoshima.” Shaun McKenna 17:57 So help us put this into context. Why is inconvenient art so special? Like why are you, Thu, and all the Japanese people, driving around in the heat looking for polka-dot pumpkins? Thu-Huong Ha 18:09 So I like this quote from this book about classical Japanese travel literature by Meredith McKinney. It's called, “Travels with a Writing Brush.” And it's about Heian Kyoto, which is like 800-1,200. You know, you think it's a really far thing in the past. But, what she says is that “an understandable distaste for travel was heavily reinforced by the firm conviction that the Capital (present-day Kyoto), as it was generally called, was really the only place for a civilized person to be. ... The Capital was the central site of culture, and the land beyond its borders quickly shaded off into the cultural equivalent of ‘the wilds.’” And I think that could just as easily apply today to New York or Paris or London or Tokyo. Art concentrates in the cultural capitals because that's where people buy it. In Tokyo. The galleries are in Ginza in Shibuya, Roppongi. There's a bunch of new art fairs that are in the cities. The aim of those is to bring all these galleries together in this really, you know, densely crowded place so that collectors can have easy and efficient access to new works. And they don't even have to take a train, right? People really don't want to be inconvenienced when they're like shopping. Shaun McKenna 19:22 Yeah this is more about shopping than art. I get that. OK. Thu-Huong Ha 19:26 But even on the museum side, like, so not the commercial side, Japan really favors what are called blockbuster exhibitions. Large scale shows of big name crowd pleasers, often require a bunch of paintings to be shipped in from Europe. They're not resilient. They need to be carefully lit, kept in climate controlled conditions. They're heavily patrolled by staff who, you know, control the photography and people's behavior. But you know, the founders of Japan's inconvenient art movement, they really wanted to challenge the urban monopoly on art. They wanted something different And in their success, you know, definitely I would call it mainstream success, they've radically changed the way that culture is consumed in contemporary Japan, there's actually good reason to think that this could be reflecting back on the market itself. So last year, according to a global markets report, put out by Art Basel, there was a surge in interest among global art collectors and acquiring work from Japan, which isn't something that the industry has seen since postwar decades, his kind of like, you know, Japan is hip again, I guess. And as a Roppongi gallerist kind of speculative to me, he thinks that Naoshima could actually have a big part in this. So previously, collectors, when they came from abroad, they would just, you know, go to Tokyo, they would go to Kyoto, they would stop, you know, in the cities, but now they're gonna be definitely stopping and Naoshima. It's kind of like an essential stop on any Japan art trip. And this gallerist says that he believes that the exposure that they have to these kind of more remote parts of Japan, their nature, history, culture, you know, could be actually fueling a burgeoning interest among collectors to have a closer relationship to Japan in general. And that could actually genuinely be moving the needle on the business of contemporary Japanese art. Shaun McKenna 21:18 You know, when I think of the art that's on display in Naoshima, I'm kind of thinking like, where does the art kind of stop and a landmark begin? Because I think that pumpkin is even beyond art. It's kind of a landmark at this point. Thu-Huong Ha 21:32 Yeah, that's true. I mean, it's a really nice way of putting it. There are, you know, these artworks after overtime, they're gonna start to become, you know, kind of like permanent fixtures of these places. And I think that that's part of the goal. But there are, you know, there are pieces that rotate as well. And they bring in new works that are commissioned for the festivals, and they'll take them down after or some of them also get left. Shaun McKenna 21:54 OK, so it's not kind of a thing where you visit Naoshima once and then you never go back there? Thu-Huong Ha 21:57 Yeah, I think definitely, I've seen in the kind of lesser known islands, which I've also covered for the paper, there's, like, still so much to be explored, and they change. Shaun McKenna 22:11 So you talk in your piece about how you think this could be something that only happens in Japan? Thu-Huong Ha 22:15 Well, right, I think that the public funding aspect of the projects is a big part of it, you know, these local governments are really, really, really invested. But also, I think, something I noticed that intrigued me was when I talked to some artists and Oku-Noto, you know, they come from countries like India, I think Mexico, Colombia, Spain, they all said like the same thing, which is that they thought that maybe these public artworks and public art projects might only be possible in a place like Japan, where the works will just like, not be stolen or like, vandalized, and people will not, like, do a lot of graffiti on them. They all described like, a kind of respect for the works and a non touching aspect of it. So like, even kids wouldn't just like run up and start touching it. And it's not a bad thing, if you know, kids want to touch public art, that's like a normal reaction, Shaun McKenna 23:10 That one girl with the salt tower. Thu-Huong Ha 23:13 Like that, actually, to me made perfect sense as a reaction from her perspective. But I think that they can last quite a long time and in the way that the artist intended it, because of this, it's almost like bringing the museum respect for the art outside and to these public art works. But then at the same time, Japan is itself under constant risk of, you know, geological threats, something that also adds this kind of like, as we discussed before, like a bit of this, like, special fragility or vulnerability that, you know, gives it this nice extra friction. Shaun McKenna 23:48 So when thinking about this, from a tourist perspective, is this kind of like just another argument for you know, the journey is the destination kind of thing, or, you know, like, is it you know, a unique travel experience that, you know, like maybe tourists 2.0 can kind of have. Thu-Huong Ha 24:07 So, if you don't mind, I'm gonna just bring a little bit of theory here, Shaun McKenna 24:10 No, go ahead, this is Deep Dive. Thu-Huong Ha 24:13 But in literary criticism, so you know, when we talk about books, there's something called reader response theory. And, that emphasizes a very active, ongoing participation between the reader and the work. So, we typically think of in traditional reading, as we, as the reader, read a text I mean, kind of extract something from it. But in this kind of theory, it's more of a give and take, it's more of a to and fro, and you know, both kind of reader and work kind of give to each other. And I'm kind of surprised that I haven't seen as much corresponding theory in visual art, which I personally find surprising because I think that art, in many ways, is more subjective. And so what inconvenient art does like because of all this like extra hair, in your experience, it brings out an even richer and like more fruitful transaction between the viewer and the work. If it's okay for me to quote my own, my own writing. “With all its stress and obstacles, its bad weather and tangents, its knots and missed chances, art pilgrimages generate millions more threads and criss-crossings of potential.” And to me that's really the art of inconvenience. Shaun McKenna 25:28 So, even an uncultured goof like myself has heard of Naoshima and Echigo-Tsumari . That's because I read The Japan Times. Are there any other inconvenient art spots around Japan? Thu-Huong Ha 25:39 Well so yeah, if we just look at the Kitagawa projects, Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale starts in July this year. He's also doing one in Nagano Prefecture in the Fall, that's the Northern Alps Art Festival. Sounds very hard to get to, and very beautiful. And then next year will be the Setoguchi Triennale that runs all year. That's the one that's Naoshima. And then Oku-Noto Triannale, which was last Fall, as I said, it's still pending if there's going to be another one because of the earthquake. Shaun McKenna 26:08 OK, so given the torment that you've gone through on your journey, do you have any tips for other inconvenient art lovers out there? Bring Thu-Huong Ha 26:15 Bring deodorant? Shaun McKenna 26:17 OK, yeah, that's a good one. Thu-Huong Ha 26:19 GPS is very helpful. Like, you know, I think you're gonna need data. If you're not a local resident, you better get some data, right? Check the ferry schedule. There's gonna be some PDFs that you have to zoom in on to find these really Byzantine bus and ferry schedules. If you're going to see the pumpkin, you know, there's no entry fee or ticket or anything, but there will be a selfie line, so we're gonna have to get in it. And if you look outside the cities, there are these smaller, inconvenient art places. We just published a story in The Japan Times by Mio Yamada about the Simose Art Museum in Otake, which is a ways out of Hiroshima city. There's Enoura Observatory, that's an Odawara. It's this amazing, amazing space by Hiroshi Sugimoto. And then in Hakone, there's also two great art spots. There's the Open Art Museum and the Pola Museum of Art. These are all just inconvenient enough that you could spend like one day from a major city and not have to do a whole ferry. Shaun McKenna 27:25 But, you know, for people who are coming here, is Naoshima kind of like, the king? Thu-Huong Ha 27:30 I mean, I think Naoshima, it can be really rewarding. But actually for me the standout is still Teshima and I don't want to give spoilers but that's part of why it's so good is because there's almost no footage about like what's in there online. You really just have to go and see it and it's like there's no public transport. You have to go from Naoshima maybe and get like another ferry and then get an electric bike and then bike to the other side of the island. It's like super, super, super, super inconvenient. I've been there twice. I missed a boat because I was, like, so excited about it. And I was like, in there crying. And I mean, I just yeah I mean, I don't want to make it sound like super, like, culty or anything. But I think that once you see it, you'll understand why it's so special. Shaun McKenna 28:14 All right, then I guess I gotta move that one up to the top of my to-do list. Thu, thanks very much for coming on Deep Dive. Thu-Huong Ha 28:20 Thanks for having me. Shaun McKenna 28:25 My thanks again to Thu, we’ll post a link to her story about inconvenient art in the show notes. And it was announced this week that a new museum will open on Naoshima in spring of next year, it will focus on contemporary works by Japanese and other Asian artists, and it is also being designed by Tadao Ando. And in other news, Japan’s birth rate hit a new low last year of 1.2 kids per family, replacement level fertility for developed countries needs to be 2.1 children per family in order to maintain the population. The new rate is the lowest since the government began keeping records in 1947. And the recent data also shows that Japanese women are having children later in life — the average age of a first child being 31. For comparison, that number was 25.7 in 1975. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said during a news conference that the next six years, before we hit 2030, will be critical in trying to halt the depopulation trend. Tokyo is trying to do its part in reversing the trend by announcing a new dating app. Users will be required to submit documentation that they are legally single, sign a letter stating they’re willing to get married and verify their annual salary through a tax certificate.

       " {'title': 'Rich nations reap climate finance dividend, benefiting from rates and terms',\n",
       "  'date': 'May 23, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'Japan, France, Germany, the United States and other wealthy nations are reaping billions of dollars in economic rewards from a global program meant to help the developing world grapple with the effects of climate change, a review of U.N. and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data shows. The financial gains happen as part of developed nations’ pledge to send $100 billion a year to poorer countries to help them reduce emissions and cope with extreme weather. By channeling money from the program back into their own economies, wealthy countries contradict the widely embraced concept that they should compensate poorer ones for their long-term pollution that has fueled climate change, more than a dozen climate finance analysts, activists and former climate officials and negotiators have said.  Wealthy nations have loaned at least $18 billion at market-rate interest, including $10.2 billion in loans made by Japan, $3.6 billion by France, $1.9 billion by Germany and $1.5 billion by the United States, according to the review by Reuters and Big Local News, a journalism program at Stanford University. That is not the norm for loans for climate-related and other aid projects, which usually carry low or no interest. At least another $11 billion in loans — nearly all from Japan — required recipient nations to hire or purchase materials from companies in the lending countries. And at least $10.6 billion has been identified in grants from 24 countries and the European Union that similarly required recipients to hire companies, nonprofits or public agencies from specific nations — usually the donor — to do the work or provide materials. Offering climate loans at market rates or conditioning funding on hiring certain companies means that money meant for developing countries gets sent back to wealthy ones. \"From a justice perspective, that’s just deeply reprehensible,” said Liane Schalatek, associate director of the Washington branch of the Heinrich-Boll Foundation, a German think tank that promotes environmental policies. Analysts said grants that require recipients to hire wealthy countries’ suppliers are less harmful than loans with such conditions because they do not require repayment. Sometimes, they said, the arrangements are even necessary — when recipient countries lack the expertise to provide a service. But other times, they benefit donors’ economies at the expense of developing nations. That undermines the goal of helping vulnerable nations develop resilience and technology to cope with climate change, the climate and finance sources said. \"Climate finance provision should not be a business opportunity,” Schalatek said. It should \"serve the needs and priorities of recipient developing countries.”   Many of the conditional loans and grants reviewed were counted toward developed nations’ pledge to send $100 billion a year by 2020 to poorer countries disproportionately harmed by climate change. First made in 2009, the commitment was reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Roughly $353 billion was paid from 2015 through 2020. That sum included $189 billion in direct country-to-country payments, which were the focus of the analysis. More than half of that direct funding — about 54% — came in the form of loans rather than grants, a fact that rankles some representatives from indebted developing nations such as Ecuador. They say they should not have to take on more debt to solve problems largely caused by the developed world. Countries of \"the global south are experiencing a new wave of debt caused by climate finance,” said Andres Mogro, Ecuador’s former national director for adaptation to climate change. At the same time, several analysts said, rich countries are overstating their contributions to the $100 billion pledge, because a portion of their climate finance flows back home through loan repayments, interest and work contracts. \"The benefits to donor countries disproportionately overshadow the primary objective of supporting climate action in developing countries,” said Ritu Bharadwaj, principal researcher on climate governance and finance at the International Institute for Environment and Development, a U.K. policy think tank. Representatives of the main agencies that manage climate funding for Japan, Germany, France and the United States — the four countries reporting the most such funding to the U.N. — said they consider the amount of debt a country is already carrying when deciding whether to offer loans or grants. They said they prioritize grants to the poorest countries. About 83% of climate funding to the lowest-income countries was in the form of grants, the review found. But those countries also received, on average, less than half as much climate funding as higher-income nations that mostly received loans. \"A mix of loans and grants ensures that public donor funding can be directed to countries that need it most, while economically stronger countries can benefit from better-than-market rate loan conditions,” said Heike Henn, director for climate, energy and environment at Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. Germany has contributed $45 billion in climate funding, 52% of it loaned. The French Development Agency (AFD) offers developing nations low interest rates that would normally be available only to the richest countries on the open market, said Atika Ben Maid, deputy head of the AFD’s Climate and Nature Division. About 90% of France’s $28 billion contribution came in the form of loans — the highest share of any nation.   A U.S. State Department spokesperson said loans are \"appropriate and cost-effective” for revenue-producing projects. Grants typically go to other types of projects in \"low-income and climate-vulnerable communities.” The United States provided $9.5 billion in climate funding, 31% of it loaned. \"It should also be emphasized that the climate finance provisions of the Paris Agreement are not based on ‘making amends’ for harm caused by historic emissions,” the spokesperson said, when asked whether collecting market-rate interest and other financial rewards contradicts the spirit of the climate finance program. The agreement does not state outright that developed nations should make amends for historic emissions. It does reference principles of \"climate justice” and \"equity” and notes countries’ \"common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities” to grapple with climate change. It makes clear that developed countries are expected to provide climate finance. Many interpret that language to mean that wealthy nations have a responsibility to help solve climate-related problems they had an outsized role in creating, said Rachel Kyte, an Oxford University climate policy professor who was World Bank special envoy for climate change in 2014 and 2015. But the agreement was short on specifics. The pledge said nations should mobilize climate finance from \"a wide variety of sources, instruments and channels.” It did not define whether grants should be prioritized over loans. Nor did it prohibit wealthy nations from imposing terms advantageous to themselves. \"It’s like setting a building on fire and then selling the fire extinguishers outside,” Ecuador’s Mogro, who was also former climate negotiator for the G77 bloc of developing countries and China, said of the practice. Reuters and Big Local News reviewed 44,539 records of climate finance contributions reported to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the entity in charge of keeping track of the pledge. The contributions, from 34 countries and the European Union, spanned 2015 through 2020, the most recent year for which data was available. The UNFCCC does not require countries to report key details of their financing. So reporters also reviewed 133,568 records collected by the OECD to identify hiring conditions tied to climate-related finance over the same period. The review confirmed that developed countries counted some conditional aid toward their $100 billion climate finance commitment. Because the UNFCCC records lack detail, it was not possible to determine whether all such aid was counted. To better understand the funding patterns revealed by the data, reporters consulted 38 climate and development finance analysts and scholars, climate activists, former and current climate officials and negotiators for developing nations, and representatives of development agencies for wealthy nations. The findings come as countries try to negotiate a new, higher climate financing target by the year’s end. The U.N. has estimated that at least $2.4 trillion a year is needed to meet the targets of the Paris climate agreement, which included keeping the average global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Recent spending pales in comparison. Wealthy countries likely met the $100 billion annual goal for the first time in 2022 through direct contributions from country to country as well as multilateral funding from development banks and climate funds. The OECD estimates that wealthy nations funneled at least $164 billion toward the climate finance pledge via multilateral institutions — about 80% of it loaned — between 2015 and 2020, in addition to countries’ direct contributions.   It was not possible to determine the percentage of those loans that carried market interest rates or hiring conditions, due to uneven reporting by multilateral groups. At least $3 billion of the direct spending went to projects that did little to help countries reduce emissions or guard against the harms of climate change, a June 2023 investigation found. Large sums went to a coal plant, a hotel, chocolate shops and other projects with little or no connection to climate initiatives. Heavily indebted countries face a vicious cycle: Debt payments limit their ability to invest in climate solutions, while extreme weather causes severe economic losses, often leading them to borrow more. A 2022 report by the United Nations Development Program found that more than half of the 54 most severely indebted developing nations also ranked among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. With the amount of financing for climate projects still far from what’s needed, however, some analysts argue that lending needs to be part of the climate finance equation. Development aid representatives from the U.S., Japan, France, Germany and the European Commission say loans enable them to funnel far more money to significant projects than they could if they relied solely on grants. In interviews, eight representatives who have worked on climate issues in developing nations said they consider loans to be necessary to fund ambitious projects given the limited funding wealthy nations have allocated for climate finance. But they said future pledges should require that rich nations and multilateral institutions be more transparent about the lending terms and offer guardrails against loans that create suffocating debt. \"The way the international financial system works at the moment ... is to dig even deeper a hole,” said Kyte, the former World Bank climate envoy who recently advised the U.K. in climate negotiations. \"We have to say, ‘no, no more digging, we’re going to fill the hole and lift you up.’” Echoing years of pleas from developing nations, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell has publicly urged wealthy nations to offer so-called concessional loans, with very low interest rates and long repayment periods. This makes them less costly than those sold on the open market. UNFCCC and OECD had no comment for this report. The UNFCCC referred to Stiell’s past remarks. About 18% of climate loans from wealthy countries, or $18 billion, were not concessional, the U.N. reports from 2015 through 2020 show, including more than half of the loans that the United States and Spain each reported. These totals are likely underestimated, given that it is voluntary for wealthy nations to report to the U.N. whether their loans were concessional. France gave a $118.6 million nonconcessional loan to Ecuador’s port city Guayaquil in 2017 to build an aerial tramway. The loan, which France counted as part of its climate finance pledge, shows how the global program can create expensive debt in developing countries in exchange for few environmental gains, while lending nations benefit. Dubbed the Aerovia, the cabled gondolas were billed as a climate-friendly alternative to the congested bridges connecting industrial Guayaquil to a neighboring city where workers live. Four years after its inauguration, the Aerovia transported roughly 8,300 passengers a day. That was one-fifth of the ridership projected in early planning documents — resulting in lower-than-expected revenue and environmental benefit. Debt from the loan has added to Guayaquil’s $124 million budget deficit. Guayaquil expected to pay 5.88% interest, according to early planning documents. France was projected to earn $76 million in interest over the 20-year repayment period. That interest rate would be unusually high for a climate-related loan, finance analysts said. A 2023 OECD analysis of concessional loans from 12 developed nations and the European Union found they offered an average interest rate of 0.7% in 2020. Guayaquil and France declined to disclose the interest rate of the final loan agreement for the tramway. \"This is a classic example where a bad loan, which has been given to a country in the garb of climate finance, will create further ... financial stress,” said Bharadwaj, the climate researcher from the International Institute for Environment and Development. The loan agreement did not require Guayaquil to hire a French company. Nonetheless, French transportation company Poma won the contract to build the tramway, along with Panamanian company SOFRATESA, founded by a French citizen. The companies also operate the tramway, so the municipality collects no revenue from passenger fares to help repay the loan. Neither company responded to questions. Nearly all of the Aerovia’s components — including its cabins, electrical control panels and cables — were manufactured in France and Switzerland and then shipped to Guayaquil, according to a slide presentation prepared by the local government before the tramway’s launch. To Euan Ritchie, senior policy adviser at Development Initiatives, an international policy organization, the project amounted to a \"transfer of wealth from Ecuador to France.”   Contesting that claim, a spokesperson for the French development agency said that the tramway belongs to the city and that the agency assessed the risk of financial stress before approving the loan. The aerial tramway has already resulted in a \"significant greenhouse gas reduction,” despite low ridership, said the spokesperson, who provided no estimates. The spokesperson said the agency does not participate in selecting contractors. Still, France’s development agency has trumpeted the successes of French companies in landing such contracts. The agency’s 2022 annual report said that more than 71% of its projects that year involved \"at least one French economic actor,” garnering them €2 billion ($2.17 billion) in \"economic benefits.” The spokesperson declined to provide estimates of how French suppliers benefit from climate-related funding. French companies often win bids because they have \"in-depth knowledge and local presence” in regions where AFD sends significant aid, the spokesperson said, adding that it \"in no way favors any entities based on their nationality.” Almost 32% of all Japanese climate loans required borrowers to use at least some of the money to hire Japanese companies, OECD records show. Those loans have funneled at least $10.8 billion back to the Japanese economy, the review found. The loan requirements helped Sumitomo and Japan Transport Engineering win three contracts worth more than $1.3 billion to supply 648 train cars for electrified railway and subway projects in the Philippines. A Sumitomo sister company, Sumitomo Mitsui Construction, won two contracts worth more than $1 billion to build rail expansion and station buildings. A Sumitomo spokesperson said that though the loans required the main contractor to be Japanese, they did not require the use of Japanese subcontractors. The spokesperson did not reply when asked if the company used local subcontractors for the Philippine rail project. Japan Transport Engineering did not respond to questions. Aid with hiring conditions robs local companies of business opportunities and eliminates chances for developing countries to build expertise in sustainable technologies, said Erika Lennon, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law. Eleven sources said the requirements contradict Paris Agreement clauses that urge parties to prioritize \"technology transfer and capacity-building” for developing countries. Asked about Japan’s conditional loans, Kiyofumi Takashima, a spokesperson for the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), said they carry very favorable terms for borrowers and usually involve local consultants, contractors and workers. Japanese consultants and contractors make \"full efforts to transfer technology and skill” to local actors, he said. JICA policy during the time period covered by the review required that this type of loan carry an interest rate of 0.1% and a 40-year repayment period. Conditional aid can carry additional costs because recipients can’t consider cheaper contractors. In 2001, the OECD recommended a halt to such requirements, citing its own 1991 study that found they can increase costs for recipient nations by up to 30%. Saori Katada, a Japan foreign policy expert at the University of Southern California, cited academic research that has found that Japanese companies usually charge more than their counterparts from neighboring countries, like China, Korea or Taiwan. \"Maybe it’s a good quality, but it’s always very expensive,” Katada said. Other countries frequently impose similar hiring requirements on grants. Reporters found that 18% of all climate-related grants reported to the OECD between 2015 and 2020 carried such requirements for all or part of the grant. The European Union extended $4 billion in grants that required recipients to hire companies or agencies from specific countries. The United States reported $3 billion and Germany $2.7 billion in grants with similar strings attached. A spokesperson from Germany’s Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development said that their grants do not require hiring German companies and that there is no policy to favor national suppliers. However, they frequently require recipient countries to pay Germany’s international development agency, GIZ, for consulting and other technical services, the spokesperson said. Nearly all of the European Union’s aid since 2021 has been free of such hiring requirements, an EU spokesperson said. All aid, regardless of who gets the contracts to do the work, benefits recipient countries, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said. The spokesperson contested the notion that the U.S. had imposed grant conditions that funneled $3 billion back to its own economy. The aid might have required hiring of companies or agencies from other countries — not just the U.S. — said the spokesperson, who did not offer any specific examples. OECD data lists U.S. companies, nonprofits or governmental agencies as the main entities receiving money from at least 80% of the U.S. conditional climate grants, totaling $2.4 billion. This is \"part of the same story of the financing going in the wrong direction,” Kyte said.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group all forecast record profits for the year started in April, after the country’s central bank ended its policy of negative interest rates. MUFG, Japan’s largest lender, expects net income of ¥1.5 trillion ($9.6 billion), a 0.7% increase from the previous year. SMFG aims for a 10% increase to ¥1.06 trillion and Mizuho expects profit to gain 10.5% to ¥750 billion.  The banks are benefiting from an earnings boost following the Bank of Japan’s shift in March. Big banks, including the three, have about ¥200 trillion at the central bank reserve and with the annual 0.1% interest on the amount beyond the minimum requirement, they earn about ¥200 billion. At SMFG, net income surged more than fourfold to ¥170 billion, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended in March. Earnings were helped by strong loan demand, driven by a pickup in corporate client activity. Mizuho’s fourth-quarter net income more than tripled to ¥36.7 billion. \"Everything worked favorably for the banking business,” SMFG Chief Executive Toru Nakashima said at a briefing. The end of the BOJ’s negative rates policy raised SMFG’s net interest income by ¥40 billion and it will gain another ¥40 billion for each increase of 10 basis points in the policy rate. Mizuho said the end of negative rates added ¥45 billion to its profit. Both MUFG and SMFG plan to buy back about ¥100 billion worth of their own shares. SMFG also plans to raise its dividend by ¥60 to ¥330 per share. Mizuho Chief Executive Masahiro Kihara said the bank would not do a share buyback until it built up sufficient capital reserves for investing in its growth strategy.'},\n",

       "  'date': 'May 9, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'Bank of Japan board members turned overwhelmingly hawkish at their April policy meeting, with many calling for the need to raise interest rates steadily to forestall risks of an inflation overshoot, a summary of opinions at the meeting showed. Some members saw the chance of a faster-than-expected pace of interest rate hikes on heightening prospects of inflation durably staying, or even exceeding, the BOJ\\'s 2% target, the summary showed Thursday.  \"If underlying inflation continues to deviate upward from the baseline scenario against the backdrop of a weaker yen, it is quite possible that the pace of monetary policy normalization will accelerate,\" one member was quoted as saying. The debate underscores BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda\\'s recent remarks signalling the chance of multiple rate hikes ahead, and heightens the possibility of an increase in short-term borrowing costs in coming months. At the April meeting, the BOJ kept interest rates near zero and produced fresh quarterly estimates that projected inflation to stay near 2% through early 2027, signalling its readiness to hike borrowing costs later this year. Many of the opinions shown in the summary called for the need to raise interest rates steadily, and consider reducing the size of the BOJ\\'s bond purchases sometime in the future. One member said the BOJ should consider raising rates moderately to avoid being forced to hike in a \"discontinuous and rapid\" way once its price target is sustainably met. Another said the BOJ must raise interest rates in a \"timely and appropriate manner,\" as the likelihood of achieving its growth and price projections heightens, the summary showed. \"If the outlook shown in our April quarterly report is realized, our 2% inflation target will be sustainably and stably achieved in about two years and the output gap will be positive. Therefore, there\\'s a chance our policy interest rate will be higher than the path currently priced in by the market,\" another opinion showed. Many market players expect the BOJ to hike interest rates later this year, though they are divided on how quickly borrowing costs might rise thereafter. Other opinions also called for the BOJ to indicate, at some point, its intentions on reducing its huge bond buying and starting to shrink its balance sheet, the summary showed. \"One option is to reduce the Bank\\'s monthly purchase amount of JGBs — which is currently about ¥6 trillion per month — based on the market\\'s supply and demand balance to restore market functioning,\" one opinion showed, referring to Japanese government bonds. A separate opinion said the BOJ should eventually eliminate its holdings of exchange-traded funds (ETF), even if doing so might take a long time, the summary showed. In March, the BOJ ended eight years of negative interest rates and other remnants of its radical stimulus program, including its bond yield control and purchases of risky assets like ETFs. While the BOJ no longer buys ETFs from the market, it continues to buy roughly ¥6 trillion worth of JGBs per month and has held off on selling bonds or ETFs.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'BOJ introduces first rate hike in 17 years following pay gains',\n",
       "  'date': 'Mar 19, 2024',\n",
       "  'content': 'The Bank of Japan on Tuesday decided to scrap the world’s last negative rate policy, introducing a rate hike for the first time in 17 years. The historic move follows robust pay increases that have heightened the BOJ’s confidence that a healthy wage-price cycle is taking root in Japan. The central bank said in a statement, released after its two-day policy meeting, that such a cycle is more evident now, and “it came in sight that the price stability target of 2% would be achieved in a sustainable and stable manner” in the coming years.  Yet BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda hinted that it would be some time before the central bank rolls out further rate hikes. “We will likely be able to avoid a path of rapid rate hikes based on the current economic outlook,” Ueda said during a news conference after the meeting. The negative rate policy, which was implemented in 2016, had been a symbol of the BOJ’s ultraloose monetary stimulus that lasted over a decade, and its end highlights how the central bank finally intends to roll back the complex policy settings crafted under previous Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda. The BOJ had set short-term interest rates at minus 0.1% for some banks’ excess funds at the central bank, but terminated the negative rate and set a new target of zero percent to 0.1% for the overnight call rate. On top of the shift from negative rates, the BOJ also said it would terminate its so-called yield curve control program, which is designed to control 10-year Japanese Government Bond yields to around zero percent with a 1% loose upper cap through the purchasing of JGBs. But the BOJ will remain committed to buying basically the same amount of JGBs and flexibly adjusting to prevent a rapid increase in interest rates. The combination of negative rates and the JGB buying operation kept Japan’s interest rates at ultralow levels. In addition, the central bank said it is ending its purchasing of exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts known as J-REIT. Ueda said those unorthodox measures had fulfilled their roles and that the BOJ will be running a “normal monetary policy.” “The primary policy instrument to manage the monetary policy from now on will be short-term interest rates,” Ueda said. Short-term interest rates will be set in the same way as other central banks that use them as a policy tool, he added. “Thus, the appropriate level of rates will be set in line with the price and economic outlook.” Although the negative rates policy has come to an end, the yen dropped sharply on Tuesday, breaching the ¥150 level against the dollar for the first time in two weeks. That was attributed to the central bank signaling that another rate hike will not come in the near future.   Traditionally, the monetary policies of central banks had been based on the premise that interest rates would not fall below zero. But the BOJ turned to the unorthodox measure after Kuroda’s radical quantitative and qualitative easing — intended to fight deflation — did not really bear fruit. However, the negative rate policy, which was also introduced by the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank in 2014, did not really spur healthy inflation. When Kuroda first introduced his unprecedented monetary easing in 2013, his initial plan was to achieve the 2% inflation target within two years, but the goal remained elusive during his tenure, which ended last April. In the end, what changed Japan’s wage and price situation was an outside shock — namely, high import costs triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war. That was followed and exacerbated by a severe weakening of the yen, itself prompted by the BOJ keeping negative rates in place even as other central banks raised rates to tame their own spiraling inflation. Due to the soaring import costs, a slew of Japanese firms have raised prices and wages in the past couple of years, opening up space for the BOJ to shift from its unorthodox aggressive monetary easing. This year’s spring wage negotiations involving major Japanese firms have delivered strong pay increases, with the preliminary figure for the average hike standing at a 33-year high of 5.28%, according to Japan’s largest labor organization, better known as Rengo. That is considerably higher than last year’s preliminary figure of 3.8%. “The first tally from Rengo turned out to be surprisingly high. I think this was the deciding factor” for the BOJ to make the move, said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute. Ueda had said that the wage hike trend that emerged from the negotiations, known as shuntō, would be important in determining whether a virtuous cycle of wage and price hikes was in sight — a condition for the BOJ to start the normalization of its monetary policy. Although inflation has stayed above the BOJ’s target of 2% for almost two years, wage growth has failed to keep up with price hikes. As such, the level of pay raise stemming from shuntō was seen as a key factor. While the BOJ has unwound its ultraloose monetary stimulus, the bank said it would maintain its dovish stance for the time being. Despite the strong wage growth, the economy is not in its best shape, with consumption remaining sluggish. Ueda said that the central bank will be ready to raise rates when the base inflation rate rises and the economic situation comes closer to the stable and sustainable 2% price target. “There is no need to rush to raise rates, since prices are not expected to increase at a rapid pace. At this stage, I think the BOJ is not intending to introduce another rate hike anytime soon,” Ueno said. Other factors are also likely to make the BOJ cautious when it comes to navigating monetary policy. For instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve is looking to implement rate cuts this year, so if the BOJ further raises rates, the yen might rapidly gain in value, impacting the economy. The BOJ’s rate hikes would also increase borrowing costs for the government, which relies on JGBs to help finance its budget. “Since various factors will continue to intertwine in a complex manner, I believe that communication with the market will continue to be important,” Ueno said.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Friday that authorities would take appropriate action against excessive currency market moves, repeating his warning to investors against pushing down the yen too much. There has been growing market interest in the timing and pace of a pivot by the U.S. and European central banks toward less restrictive monetary policy, Suzuki said.  \"Uncertainty and market speculation over these developments have heightened volatility in financial markets, including foreign exchange markets,\" Suzuki said in a statement to the International Monetary Fund\\'s steering committee. \"It is important that foreign exchange rates move stably, reflecting fundamentals, and excessive volatility is not desirable. We would take appropriate actions against excessive movements,\" he said during the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. A broad dollar rally driven by receding market expectations of a near-term U.S. interest rate cut has recently pushed the yen to a 34-year low, heightening the chance of currency intervention by Japanese authorities. The U.S., Japan and South Korea agreed to \"consult closely\" on foreign exchange markets in their first trilateral finance dialogue on Wednesday, acknowledging concerns from Tokyo and Seoul over their currencies\\' recent sharp declines.'}]"
