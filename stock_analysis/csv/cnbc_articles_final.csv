10-year Treasury yield falls from highs after auction eases concerns about demand for U.S. debt,"PUBLISHED WED, APR 9 20255:42 AM EDT","The 10-year Treasury yield retreated from its highs of the day after a successful bond auction eased concerns about demand for U.S. debt. The bond market — not a plunging stock market — has been the talk of Wall Street with prices tumbling and yields spiking, unusual action during times when fears of a recession are growing and fixed income is usually relied on as a safe haven from turmoil elsewhere. But yields were backing off the highs Wednesday afternoon. A 90-day pause in some tariffs announced by President Donald Trump helped to eased some mounting worries in the fixed income market. The 10-year Treasury note yield was last up 5 basis points to 4.31% after climbing overnight above 4.51%. As recently as last week, the 10-year yield, which helps decide rates on mortgages, credit card debt and auto loans, was below 3.9%. The 30-year Treasury bond yield
hit a high of 5.02% overnight, a level not seen since November 2023. It was last at 4.715%. The 2-year Treasury yield rose nearly 17 basis points to 3.908%, jumping in afternoon trading. The upward move for short-term yields could be a sign that traders think the tariff pause will make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut rates at its upcoming meetings. One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%. Yields and prices move in opposite directions. The bid-cover ratio for the auction of $39 billion in 10-year Treasurys was 2.67, much higher than the prior 10-year auction, indicating strong demand. So-called indirects accounted for more than 87% of the bids, signaling solid demand from holders such as foreign investors."
CNBC Daily Open: The humongous 104% tariff on China is live — even Musk seems perturbed,"PUBLISHED WED, APR 9 20252:30 AM EDT","Trump tariffs have officially kicked in — and they include a ghastly 104% duty on Chinese imports.  Despite growing consternation and concern expressed by economists and CEOs, Trump administration officials have been stubborn in defending its trade policies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Tuesday that roughly 70 countries want to discuss deals with the White House, while trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday said tariffs are not negotiable. (Whether discussing deals is a form of negotiation is apparently debatable.)  But at least one member of the Trump cadre doesn’t seem too happy about the tariffs. Elon Musk, while not addressing the White House’s trade policies specifically, described Navarro — the administration’s top trade advisor — as a “moron” and “dangerously dumb.” Musk is the de facto DOGE leader, a key role in the Trump administration. He is also the CEO of Tesla, a multinational company. Still, given how staunchly White House officials have been advocating for tariffs, it doesn’t seem likely that Musk’s public feud with Navarro will staunch the wound on global trade."

CNBC Daily Open: Markets rise for the second day as U.S. consumers continue spending,"PUBLISHED TUE, MAR 18 20253:30 AM EDT","The Wall Street adage to never bet against the U.S. consumer still holds true — to some degree. February’s retail sales, while lower than expected, still registered an increase. For the skeptics, that is like desperately squinting for a silver lining. It might very well be. But the dark clouds, in the form of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, are more ominous than usual. Tariffs, after all, are a tax on imported goods that will likely be passed on to the consumer. That has weighed on consumer sentiment, as measured by surveys like those from the University of Michigan. Even U.S. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett acknowledged that Trump’s tariffs will cause some uncertainty. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has already lowered its growth outlook for the U.S. because of that. While the Trump administration is confident that stocks will recover their footing, strategists may also start revising downward their market forecast if the outlook does not clear up."

That said, the layoff of federal workers by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency happened after the survey was conducted, CNBC’s Jeff Cox noted, which means the downward drag on data would likely appear only in March’s jobs report. One immediate apparent effect of DOGE, on the other hand, is the seven-week slide in Tesla shares ever since Musk stationed himself in Washington, D.C. The actions of DOGE, along with other policies that U.S. President Donald Trump is deploying to reshape the U.S., are so drastic that the Federal Reserve is taking note and getting into a wait-and-see stance. But investors aren’t waiting — they’re seeing the confusion and dumping stocks already."
CNBC Daily Open: Trump paused tariffs for some imports — but Nasdaq enters correction territory,"PUBLISHED FRI, MAR 7 20252:30 AM EST","U.S. President Donald Trump expanded his tariff pause to goods coming in from Canada and Mexico, so long as they satisfy terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal between all countries. Unlike Trump’s Wednesday reprieve to automakers, which bumped up stocks, investors weren’t relieved this time. All major U.S. benchmarks sank, with the Nasdaq Composite limping into correction territory and losing its post-election Trump bump. That might be because the Trump administration seems to be doubling down on tariffs, even as it acknowledges — and dismisses — the repercussions of such levies. Trump brushed off the idea that he’s watching the markets, causing dismay in investors who were banking on the “Trump put,” the idea that the current president would prevent a steep drop in the stocks. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent waved away the idea of “cheap goods” as integral to the “American dream.”"

CNBC Daily Open: Nvidia’s earnings are steady — but U.S. consumer confidence is shaky,"PUBLISHED THU, FEB 27 20252:30 AM EST","Nvidia’s revenue in 2024 more than doubled compared with a year earlier, beating analysts’ expectations. Moreover, the company expects sales in the current quarter will continue to grow at a faster rate than Wall Street’s estimates. Much of that falls upon Nvidia’s new Blackwell artificial intelligence chip, which Big Tech companies are pouring billions into. The chipmaker also downplayed concerns over DeepSeek, saying that more efficient AI models still require plenty of processing power in the long run. Meanwhile, consumer surveys from the Consumer Board and the University of Michigan show intensifying concerns over the economy and inflation. That’s culminated in the 10-year Treasury yield passing below that of the 3-month note, causing an “inverted yield curve” — an accepted, and largely accurate, sign of an impending recession within 18 months. Even as Nvidia is raking in revenue and Big Tech is powering ahead with capex, confidence in the U.S. economy seems to be wobbling slightly. It remains to be seen if tech can stabilize that."

CNBC Daily Open: U.S. takes aim at neighbors with tariffs again,"PUBLISHED TUE, FEB 25 20252:30 AM EST","It’s quiet… too quiet. After a few quiet weeks on the tariff front, U.S. President Donald Trump has again set his sights on Canada and Mexico, promising that tariffs paused earlier this month will “go forward” next week.  Trump signed executive orders on Feb. 1 imposing 25% tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% duties on Canadian energy. Separately, the row between U.S. federal workers and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency continued after the Office of Personnel Management seemed to undermine Musk’s threat to federal workers.  Musk’s DOGE had sent out an email to all federal workers last week, saying those who fail to submit a list of their recent accomplishments will face a forced “resignation.” OPM later notified top government human resources officers that responses to the email “is voluntary.” But Musk then doubled down on his threat, saying in a post on X on Monday night “Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.” — Lim Hui Jie"

A day prior, the Bank of England lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, following the European Central Bank’s cut of the same amount on Jan. 30. Many economies seem to be settling into a lower-rate environment as policymakers look to boost economic growth. That’s in stark contrast with the U.S. — it’s unclear if the U.S. Federal Reserve would even deliver on its two rate cuts in 2025, forecast in December, given the uncertainties over the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies. Moreover, Trump seems to have backed off from applying pressure on the Fed. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. dollar began strengthening and hit its highest level in more than two years, as measured by the U.S. dollar index. That’s already affected companies such as Amazon, which blamed the currency for weighing down its expected revenue in the current quarter. The U.S. might have an edge over other economies and stock markets for now, but an edge can cut both ways."

closed at a record high. China related stocks were on the move Tuesday after the People’s Bank of China said it will cut interest rates. The Chinese central bank also unveiled other stimulus measures. 2. Club name Starbucks
was downgraded to an underperform sell rating from hold at Jefferies. The analysts don’t seem to be believers in new CEO Brian Niccol, the former boss of Chipotle. They characterized the stock gains since the CEO switch as too much, too soon. They think a reset to Starbucks fiscal 2025 guide is coming. What the Jefferies downgrade misses is the market is giving Starbucks a pass as Niccol builds his team and makes changes. 3. Truist downgraded Club holding Costco
to a hold rating ahead of earnings, which are out after Thursday’s close. The analysts said the stock’s valuation leaves little room for error. We can’t argue against the stock being expensive but it always is. Truist also upgraded Walmart to buy on accelerating share gains and fast-growing higher margin revenue streams like advertising."

One factor playing a role in the sell-off Monday was the unwinding of the popular “carry trade” strategy that seeks to profit on interest rate differentials. We took advantage of the volatility to put cash to work in quality U.S. stocks that were being dragged down. On Tuesday, the Nikkei 225, which had its largest decline in the previous session since the 1987 Black Monday crash — rose more than 10%. 2. Uber
reported much better-than-expected results for the second quarter: EPS of 47 cents vs. consensus estimate of 31 cents, according to LSEG; $10.7 billion vs. $10.57 billion expected. The stock rose 6% in pre-market trading. 3. Google loses case but wins the war? A federal U.S. judge ruled Monday the company has illegally held a monopoly in search and text advertising, with the court focusing in on the Alphabet
company’s exclusive arrangements on Android and Apple
devices. Barclays sees both Google and Apple as losers from the ruling. I don’t buy that. Google said it plans to appeal. Both Google and Apple are longtime Club holdings."

and Nasdaq
were headed for higher opens Friday after the Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation gauge, the core PCE price index, matched estimates. Both stock measures were tracking lower for the week, with Wednesday’s worst session since 2022 accounting for the bulk of the losses in the recent rotation out of tech shares. Megacap tech earnings Part 2 comes next week. 2. The June personal consumption expenditures index, excluding food and energy prices, showed a monthly increase of 0.2% and 2.6% on the year. Both were in line with expectations. The data didn’t sway the market odds on the Fed cutting interest rates three times this year, starting in September. No action is expected at next week’s central bank meeting."

Here’s why investors should stop worrying so much about concentration risk in the market,"PUBLISHED FRI, FEB 23 20248:49 AM EST","After a brief respite, the Magnificent 7 stocks have again hit new highs on the heels of Nvidia’s blowout earnings: They now again comprise about 30% of the S&P 500. Throw in the remainder of the top 10 stocks (Berkshire Hathaway, Lilly, and Broadcom) and the concentration rises to about 33% of the S&P 500. At the recent ETF conference in Miami Beach, Registered investment advisors were eager for advice on how they might get their clients to stop pestering them to invest more money in the Magnificent 7. There was much handwringing about the dangers of over-concentration. RIAs worried that just like they get blamed for not being in the Mag 7 rally with sufficient zest, they will get clobbered by clients blaming them when (and if) they bubble bursts. The hope of the RIAs was the market rally would broaden out. Fat chance. That was two weeks ago, during a brief lull in the relentless march of Nvidia and the Magnificent 7. But Nvidia’s earnings have killed the last hope of the “diversify” crowd. The numbers speak for themselves: Major Sectors YTD Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) up 20% (25% Nvidia!) Roundhill Magnificent 7 ETF (MAGS) up 14% (14% Nvidia!) S&P 500 up 5% (4% Nvidia!) S&P 500 Equal-Weight ETF (RSP) up 2% On the surface, it sure seems that way. The comparisons are getting silly. At the ETF conference, Dimensional Fund Advisors noted that the Magnificent 7 stocks were now just as large as the entire combined stock markets of Japan, UK, Canada, France, Hong Kong/China combined: Magnificent 7 vs. The World (MSCI All Country World Index weighting) Entire U.S. stock market: 63% Japan, UK, Canada, France, Hong Kong/China combined: 17.5% Magnificent 7: 17% Source: Dimensional Funds That seems crazy, no? And yet, it’s not at all unusual to see concentration like this in prior periods. And it’s mostly around tech. It’s true concentration has risen in the last 10 years. As late as 2015, the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 were only 17.8% of the index, according to a 2023 study by FS Investments. But that was a low point. Most of the time, the concentration of the top 10 stocks has been far higher. For example, in the mid-1960s the concentration of the top 10 was over 40% of the S&P 500. The domination of the so-called “Nifty 50” stocks (which included IBM, American Express, General Electric, Polaroid and Xerox) in the 1960s and early 1970s regularly kept the concentration of the top 10 stocks over 30%. It slowly declined over the next 20 years, settling between roughly 17% and 20% of the market capitalization of the S&P 500 between the 1980s and the late 1990s. It shot up again during the dotcom and Internet boom, which again pushed the concentration of the top 10 to over 25% in the late 1990s. Other countries like China, France, and Germany have far higher concentration in the top 10 names than the U.S. The broadest China ETF, the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI
) has over 600 stocks. But the top 10 stocks, which include Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu, comprise 42% of the entire ETF. Same with Germany: The iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG
) has 57% of its weighting in 10 stocks, with 22% in just two stocks, SAP and Siemens. Same with the United Kingdom: The iShares MSCI UK (EWU
) has 50% in the top 10 holdings, with nearly a quarter in three stocks, Shell, AstraZeneca, and HSBC. Same with France: The iShares MSCI France (EWQ
) has 57% in the top 10 with just two companies — LVMH and Total — comprising 20% of the weighting. And same with Canada: The iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index (XIU
) has 45% in the top 10 holdings. Concentration of top 10 stocks in country indexes China 42% Germany 57% UK: 50% France: 57% Canada 45% U.S.: 33% You may worry about it, but concentration has been a boon to index investors and to U.S. investors in general. We all know the majority of the gains in the last year can be attributed to a small number of mostly tech stocks. Investors who own the S&P 500
don’t have to pick those winners; they just go along for the ride. Second, U.S. stocks are global market leaders, and when a small group becomes market leaders it almost always means the U.S. stock market outperforms the world. That is exactly what has happened. The U.S. stock market, which was roughly 40% of the global market capitalization a short while ago, is now roughly 50% of global market capitalization. U.S. investors in broadly diversified indexes have been richly rewarded for their “concentration risk.” Here’s what it all means: Concentration is a characteristic of market cap-weighted indexes. These indexes reward the winners and penalize the losers. The reason the Magnificent 7 has done so well is that these are the most profitable companies in the world. They are at the cutting edge of transformative technologies, particularly AI. That’s the primary reason they are the leaders. There are also secondary reasons: globalization, which made supply chains more efficient, and the long decline in interest rates (which has come to an end). But the bottom line is that in an era where growth has been hard to come by, these companies have plenty of it. And investors are willing to pay up. What about comparisons to the dot-com era? The stocks at the top contribute a far greater amount to the earnings of the S&P 500 than they did in the 1990s. And the cash flow is much higher. There’s already been a correction: It was called 2022 At the ETF conference, the big worry among the RIAs was, “But what if there’s a big correction in the Magnificent 7?” Uh, sorry, but they already corrected. Nvidia went from roughly $292 at the start of 2022 to $112 by October of that year, a drop of 62%. The other Magnificent 7 stocks all had big drops then. Of course they could all correct again. But the AI revolution is very real. Nvidia’s sales tripled. Profits were up 800%. That is a very real revolution."
