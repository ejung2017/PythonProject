joined the $4 trillion club after reporting an incredible acceleration of business, especially from its AI digital assistant Copilot and its Azure cloud division. It was an extraordinary quarter, so much better than six months ago. It was actually constrained by not enough computing power. The Club stock rose 8% this morning following last night’s earnings print. 2. Club name Meta Platforms
shares jumped nearly 12% this morning after the social media giant delivered a stunningly good quarter and strong guidance last night. It looks like the AI bets are paying off both in innovation and in advertising. Family of Apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, saw users rise to nearly 3.5 billion. Smart glasses form factor is the one that will win AI. 3. A powerful earnings-driven tech stock rally this morning was positioning the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq for higher opens. Club names Apple
and Amazon
report earnings tonight. Apple has a tall order to win back Wall Street’s favor, while Amazon also needs a strong showing. Updates on AI and tariffs will be themes on both conference calls to watch."

Jim Cramer’s top 10 things to watch in the stock market Tuesday,"PUBLISHED TUE, JUL 29 20259:10 AM EDT","1. Novo Nordisk
shares sank more than 20% this morning after the maker of Ozempic cut its full-year guidance and named a new CEO. The company cited “persistent use of compounded GLP-1s.” Club name Eli Lilly
, which competes with Mounjaro and Zepbound, saw its stock drop 4% following the Novo Nordisk news. Lilly reports earnings Aug. 7. 2. Also in the Club portfolio, Starbucks
is set to report earnings after this afternoon’s closing bell. We want to hear about how CEO Brian Niccol’s turnaround efforts are going. We have faith in Niccol’s ability to right the ship based on his overhaul of Chipotle. However, it looks like Starbucks is going to be a much harder turn. 3. UnitedHealth
reported a dramatic guide down but forecast a return to growth in 2026. Doesn’t seem like a trusted forecast. The troubled company reported its mixed quarter just days after it said it was cooperating with the Justice Department investigation into its Medicare billing. The Dow stock, already on a slide since April, dropped roughly 1.5% this morning. 4. Merck
, also a Dow stock, dropped 4% after the drugmaker announced a goal of $3 billion in cost cuts by the end of 2027. The company is positioning ahead of blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda patent expiration in 2028. Merck also reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, the first miss since April 2021, and narrowed its full-year guidance. 5. Boeing
was a Dow stock winner this morning after cutting quarterly losses and reporting the most deliveries of planes since 2018. Revenue beat expectations. CEO Kelly Ortberg said “change takes time,” but he sees 2025 as “our turnaround year.” The stock rose nearly 1% this morning, adding to its more than 30% year-to-date gains. 6. Procter & Gambl
e shares gained nearly 2% after the consumer products giant beat on quarterly earnings and revenue. P&G announced fiscal 2026 guidance that included a $1 billion drag due to higher costs from tariffs. It also cited unfavorable commodity costs, higher net interest expense and core effective tax rates. The company also announced a CEO transition. 7. Union Pacific
has agreed to buy smaller rival Norfolk Southern
in a $85 billion deal. If approved, the combined company would be the nation’s first coast-to-coast freight rail operator. There are reports that this deal has prompted competitors BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway
, and CSX
to explore merger options. 8. Wall Street was on track for a higher open, which would add to yesterday’s 15th record close of the year for the S&P 500
. The United States and China resumed trade talks today after the weekend announcement of a trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union. Last week, President Donald Trump unveiled a trade deal with Japan. 9. Club name Nvidia
, according to Reuters, has placed orders with its manufacturer, Taiwan Semi
, for 300,000 China-specific H20 chips. The report indicated that Nvidia won’t be relying on just its stockpile of these chips, which this month got approval from the Trump administration to sell in China again. 10. Wells Fargo raised its price target on Club name Amazon
to $245 a share from $238. OK, this is the kind of fatuous PT boost based totally on conjecture that gets you in trouble because it presumes a great quarter. Amazon reports earnings after Thursday’s close.

10-year Treasury yield falls from highs after auction eases concerns about demand for U.S. debt,"PUBLISHED WED, APR 9 20255:42 AM EDT","The 10-year Treasury yield retreated from its highs of the day after a successful bond auction eased concerns about demand for U.S. debt. The bond market — not a plunging stock market — has been the talk of Wall Street with prices tumbling and yields spiking, unusual action during times when fears of a recession are growing and fixed income is usually relied on as a safe haven from turmoil elsewhere. But yields were backing off the highs Wednesday afternoon. A 90-day pause in some tariffs announced by President Donald Trump helped to eased some mounting worries in the fixed income market. The 10-year Treasury note yield was last up 5 basis points to 4.31% after climbing overnight above 4.51%. As recently as last week, the 10-year yield, which helps decide rates on mortgages, credit card debt and auto loans, was below 3.9%. The 30-year Treasury bond yield
hit a high of 5.02% overnight, a level not seen since November 2023. It was last at 4.715%. The 2-year Treasury yield rose nearly 17 basis points to 3.908%, jumping in afternoon trading. The upward move for short-term yields could be a sign that traders think the tariff pause will make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut rates at its upcoming meetings. One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%. Yields and prices move in opposite directions. The bid-cover ratio for the auction of $39 billion in 10-year Treasurys was 2.67, much higher than the prior 10-year auction, indicating strong demand. So-called indirects accounted for more than 87% of the bids, signaling solid demand from holders such as foreign investors."

CNBC Daily Open: The humongous 104% tariff on China is live — even Musk seems perturbed,"PUBLISHED WED, APR 9 20252:30 AM EDT","Trump tariffs have officially kicked in — and they include a ghastly 104% duty on Chinese imports.  Despite growing consternation and concern expressed by economists and CEOs, Trump administration officials have been stubborn in defending its trade policies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Tuesday that roughly 70 countries want to discuss deals with the White House, while trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday said tariffs are not negotiable. (Whether discussing deals is a form of negotiation is apparently debatable.)  But at least one member of the Trump cadre doesn’t seem too happy about the tariffs. Elon Musk, while not addressing the White House’s trade policies specifically, described Navarro — the administration’s top trade advisor — as a “moron” and “dangerously dumb.” Musk is the de facto DOGE leader, a key role in the Trump administration. He is also the CEO of Tesla, a multinational company. Still, given how staunchly White House officials have been advocating for tariffs, it doesn’t seem likely that Musk’s public feud with Navarro will staunch the wound on global trade."

Reciprocal tariffs on “all countries” will start Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday. While Trump has described the start of his tariffs as “liberation day,” others aren’t seeing it in quite so glowing terms. Goldman Sachs, for one, cut its forecast for U.S. economic growth and raised its expectation for the inflation rate in 2025, suggesting the possibility of stagflation. And if not stagflation — recession. The Wall Street giant also slashed its projection for the S&P 500 accordingly.

Meanwhile, consumer surveys from the Consumer Board and the University of Michigan show intensifying concerns over the economy and inflation. That’s culminated in the 10-year Treasury yield passing below that of the 3-month note, causing an “inverted yield curve” — an accepted, and largely accurate, sign of an impending recession within 18 months. Even as Nvidia is raking in revenue and Big Tech is powering ahead with capex, confidence in the U.S. economy seems to be wobbling slightly. It remains to be seen if tech can stabilize that."

CNBC Daily Open: U.S. takes aim at neighbors with tariffs again,"PUBLISHED TUE, FEB 25 20252:30 AM EST","It’s quiet… too quiet. After a few quiet weeks on the tariff front, U.S. President Donald Trump has again set his sights on Canada and Mexico, promising that tariffs paused earlier this month will “go forward” next week.  Trump signed executive orders on Feb. 1 imposing 25% tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% duties on Canadian energy. Separately, the row between U.S. federal workers and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency continued after the Office of Personnel Management seemed to undermine Musk’s threat to federal workers.  Musk’s DOGE had sent out an email to all federal workers last week, saying those who fail to submit a list of their recent accomplishments will face a forced “resignation.” OPM later notified top government human resources officers that responses to the email “is voluntary.” But Musk then doubled down on his threat, saying in a post on X on Monday night “Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.” — Lim Hui Jie"

CNBC Daily Open: Global central banks are lowering rates — the Fed might not be as inclined,"PUBLISHED FRI, FEB 7 20252:30 AM EST","On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India trimmed its repo rate by 25 basis points. A day prior, the Bank of England lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, following the European Central Bank’s cut of the same amount on Jan. 30. Many economies seem to be settling into a lower-rate environment as policymakers look to boost economic growth. That’s in stark contrast with the U.S. — it’s unclear if the U.S. Federal Reserve would even deliver on its two rate cuts in 2025, forecast in December, given the uncertainties over the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies. Moreover, Trump seems to have backed off from applying pressure on the Fed. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. dollar began strengthening and hit its highest level in more than two years, as measured by the U.S. dollar index. That’s already affected companies such as Amazon, which blamed the currency for weighing down its expected revenue in the current quarter. The U.S. might have an edge over other economies and stock markets for now, but an edge can cut both ways."

"Temperatures cool in Japan, but inbound travel shows little sign of slowing down","PUBLISHED SUN, NOV 10 20246:05 PM EST","Temperatures are cooling in Japan, but interest in visiting shows no signs of abating, as autumn arrivals continue to outpace pre-pandemic levels. The country welcomed 2.93 million foreign visitors in August, followed by another 2.87 million visitors in September — well above the 2.52 million and 2.27 million who arrived during those same months in 2019, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. Historically, Japan sees a lull of tourists in August and September, followed by a bump in visitors in October from travelers in search of fall foliage or Tokyo’s storied Halloween celebrations. But this year, that drop is expected to be muted, as the country is experiencing a long-awaited rise in arrivals from Chinese travelers, a trend which began in June. Before the pandemic, China was Japan’s largest tourism source market, representing 30% of all arrivals, according to Japanese authorities. Chinese visitors to Japan doubled last month, from 325,645 in September 2023 to 652,300 in September 2024, according to Japan’s tourism statistics."

American interest in moving abroad skyrockets after Trump’s win — here’s how many would actually leave,"PUBLISHED THU, NOV 7 202410:31 PM EST","Americans disappointed with the outcome of the U.S. election took their anguish online, with searches related to moving abroad surging following the results of the presidential race. Google Trends showed that searches related to “leaving the country” and “how to move to …” spiked following the news that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. Searches for “how to move to Canada” peaked on Nov. 6, with Google Trends showing interest in the phrase highest among Democratic strongholds, like Vermont, Maine, Oregon and Washington. Those searching for “can I move to another country” were highest in two pivotal “blue wall” swing states — Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which NBC News has called for Trump — as well as Oregon, Minnesota and Indiana. A survey conducted earlier this month found that 21% of Americans said they would consider moving abroad if their preferred candidate lost the race. However, the sentiment seemed to be founded more on frustration, rather than actual intention, according to the survey conducted by Casino.org, which provides news, information and research to gamers. Among those polled, nearly 60% said they would be “very unlikely” to move, while only 2.6% said they were “very likely” to uproot and leave."

One factor playing a role in the sell-off Monday was the unwinding of the popular “carry trade” strategy that seeks to profit on interest rate differentials. We took advantage of the volatility to put cash to work in quality U.S. stocks that were being dragged down. On Tuesday, the Nikkei 225, which had its largest decline in the previous session since the 1987 Black Monday crash — rose more than 10%. 2. Uber
reported much better-than-expected results for the second quarter: EPS of 47 cents vs. consensus estimate of 31 cents, according to LSEG; $10.7 billion vs. $10.57 billion expected. The stock rose 6% in pre-market trading. 3. Google loses case but wins the war? A federal U.S. judge ruled Monday the company has illegally held a monopoly in search and text advertising, with the court focusing in on the Alphabet
company’s exclusive arrangements on Android and Apple
devices. Barclays sees both Google and Apple as losers from the ruling. I don’t buy that. Google said it plans to appeal. Both Google and Apple are longtime Club holdings."
